Ignore quickly-repeated key presses of the same key.
Turn on bounce keys
Turn on bounce keys to ignore key presses that are rapidly repeated. For example, if you have hand tremors which cause you to press a key multiple times when you only want to press it once, you should turn on bounce keys.
Open the Activities overview and start typing Settings.
Click on Settings.
Click Universal Access in the sidebar to open the panel.
Press Typing Assist (AccessX) in the Typing section.
Switch the Bounce Keys switch to on.
Quickly turn bounce keys on and off
You can turn bounce keys on and off by clicking the accessibility icon on the top bar and selecting Bounce Keys. The accessibility icon is visible when one or more settings have been enabled from the Universal Access panel.
Use the Acceptance delay slider to change how long bounce keys waits before it registers another key press after you pressed the key for the first time. Select Beep when a key is rejected if you want the computer to make a sound each time it ignores a key press because it happened too soon after the previous key press.

Use the Orca screen reader with a refreshable Braille display.
Read screen in Braille
GNOME provides the Orca screen reader to display the user interface on a refreshable Braille display. Depending on how you installed GNOME, you might not have Orca installed. If not, install Orca first.
Install Orca
Refer to the Orca Help for more information.
Make windows and buttons on the screen more (or less) vivid, so they’re easier to see.
Adjust the contrast
You can adjust the contrast of windows and buttons so that they’re easier to see. This is not the same as changing the brightness of the whole screen; only parts of the user interface will change.
Open the Activities overview and start typing Universal Access.
Click on Universal Access to open the panel.
Switch the High Contrast switch in the Seeing section to on.
Quickly turn high contrast on and off
You can turn high contrast on and off by clicking the accessibility icon on the top bar and selecting High Contrast.
The Hover Click (Dwell Click) feature allows you to click by holding the mouse still.
Simulate clicking by hovering
You can click or drag simply by hovering your mouse pointer over a control or object on the screen. This is useful if you find it difficult to move the mouse and click at the same time. This feature is called Hover Click or Dwell Click.
When Hover Click is enabled, you can move your mouse pointer over a control, let go of the mouse, and then wait for a while before the button will be clicked for you.
Click Universal Access to open the panel.
Press Click Assist in the Pointing amp; Clicking section.
Switch Hover Click to on.
The Hover Click window will open, and will stay above all of your other windows. You can use this to choose what sort of click should happen when you hover. For example, if you select Secondary Click, you will right-click when you hover. After you double-click, right-click, or drag, you will be automatically returned to clicking.
When you hover your mouse pointer over a button and do not move it, it will gradually change color. When it has fully changed color, the button will be clicked.
Adjust the Delay setting to change how long you have to hold the mouse pointer still before clicking.
You do not need to hold the mouse perfectly still when hovering to click. The pointer is allowed to move a little bit and will still click after a while. If it moves too much, however, the click will not happen.
Adjust the Motion threshold setting to change how much the pointer can move and still be considered to be hovering.
Use larger fonts to make text easier to read.
Change text size on the screen
If you have difficulty reading the text on your screen, you can change the size of the font.
In the Seeing section, switch the Large Text switch to on.
Alternatively, you can quickly change the text size by clicking the accessibility icon on the top bar and selecting Large Text.
In many applications, you can increase the text size at any time by pressing Ctrl+. To reduce the text size, press Ctrl-.
Large Text will scale the text by 1.2 times. You can use Tweaks to make text size bigger or smaller.
The universal access menu is the icon on the top bar that looks like a person.
Find the universal access menu
The universal access menu is where you can turn on some of the accessibility settings. You can find this menu by clicking the icon which looks like a person surrounded by a circle on the top bar.
The universal access menu can be found on the top bar.
If you do not see the universal access menu, you can enable it from the Universal Access settings panel:
Switch the Always Show Universal Access Menu switch to on.
To access this menu using the keyboard rather than the mouse, press CtrlAltTab to move the keyboard focus to the top bar. A white line will appear underneath the Activities button — this tells you which item on the top bar is selected. Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the white line under the universal access menu icon and then press Enter to open it. You can use the up and down arrow keys to select items in the menu. Press Enter to toggle the selected item.
Zoom in on your screen so that it is easier to see things.
Magnify a screen area
Magnifying the screen is different than just enlarging the text size. This feature is like having a magnifying glass, allowing you to move around by zooming in on parts of the screen.
Press on Zoom in the Seeing section.
Switch the Zoom switch in the top-right corner of the Zoom Options window to on.
You can now move around the screen area. By moving your mouse to the edges of the screen, you will move the magnified area in different directions, allowing you to view your area of choice.
You can quickly turn zoom on and off by clicking the accessibility icon on the top bar and selecting Zoom.
You can change the magnification factor, the mouse tracking, and the position of the magnified view on the screen. Adjust these in the Magnifier tab of the Zoom Options window.
You can activate crosshairs to help you find the mouse or touchpad pointer. Switch them on and adjust their length, color, and thickness in the Crosshairs tab of the Zoom settings window.
You can switch to inverse video or White on black, and adjust brightness, contrast and greyscale options for the magnifier. The combination of these options is useful for people with low-vision, any degree of photophobia, or just for using the computer under adverse lighting conditions. Select the Color Effects tab in the Zoom settings window to enable and change these options.

Press and hold the left mouse button to right-click.
Simulate a right mouse click
You can right-click by holding down the left mouse button. This is useful if you find it difficult to move your fingers individually on one hand, or if your pointing device only has a single button.
In the Click Assist window, switch the Simulated Secondary Click switch to on.
You can change how long you must hold down the left mouse button before it is registered as a right click by changing the Acceptance delay.
To right-click with simulated secondary click, hold down the left mouse button where you would normally right-click, then release. The pointer fills with a different color as you hold down the left mouse button. Once it will change this color entirely, release the mouse button to right-click.
Some special pointers, such as the resize pointers, do not change colors. You can still use simulated secondary click as normal, even if you do not get visual feedback from the pointer.
If you use Mouse Keys, this also allows you to right-click by holding down the 5 key on your keypad.
In the Activities overview, you are always able to long-press to right-click, even with this feature disabled. Long-press works slightly differently in the overview: you do not have to release the button to right-click.
Use the Orca screen reader to speak the user interface.
Read screen aloud
GNOME provides the Orca screen reader to speak the user interface. Depending on how you installed GNOME, you might not have Orca installed. If not, install Orca first.
To start Orca using the keyboard:
Press Super+Alt+S.
Or to start Orca using a mouse and keyboard:
Click Screen Reader in the Seeing section, then switch Screen Reader on in the dialog.
Quickly turn Screen Reader on and off
You can turn Screen Reader on and off by clicking the accessibility icon in the top bar and selecting Screen Reader.
Have a delay between a key being pressed and that letter appearing on the screen.
Turn on slow keys
Turn on slow keys if you would like there to be a delay between pressing a key and that letter being displayed on the screen. This means that you have to hold down each key you want to type for a little while before it appears. Use slow keys if you accidentally press several keys at a time when you type, or if you find it difficult to press the right key on the keyboard first time.
Switch the Slow Keys switch to on.
Quickly turn slow keys on and off
Under Enable by Keyboard, select Turn on accessibility features from the keyboard to turn slow keys on and off from the keyboard. When this option is selected, you can press and hold Shift for eight seconds to enable or disable slow keys.
You can also turn slow keys on and off by clicking the accessibility icon on the top bar and selecting Slow Keys. The accessibility icon is visible when one or more settings have been enabled from the Universal Access panel.
Use the Acceptance delay slider to control how long you have to hold a key down for it to register.
You can have your computer make a sound when you press a key, when a key press is accepted, or when a key press is rejected because you didn’t hold the key down long enough.
Type keyboard shortcuts one key at a time rather than having to hold down all of the keys at once.
Turn on sticky keys
Sticky keys allows you to type keyboard shortcuts one key at a time rather than having to hold down all of the keys at once. For example, the SuperTab shortcut switches between windows. Without sticky keys turned on, you would have to hold down both keys at the same time; with sticky keys turned on, you would press Super and then Tab to do the same.
You might want to turn on sticky keys if you find it difficult to hold down several keys at once.
Switch the Sticky Keys switch to on.
Quickly turn sticky keys on and off
Under Enable by Keyboard, select Turn on accessibility features from the keyboard to turn sticky keys on and off from the keyboard. When this option is selected, you can press Shift five times in a row to enable or disable sticky keys.
You can also turn sticky keys on and off by clicking the accessibility icon on the top bar and selecting Sticky Keys. The accessibility icon is visible when one or more settings have been enabled from the Universal Access panel.
If you press two keys at once, you can have sticky keys turn itself off temporarily to let you enter a keyboard shortcut in the normal way.
For example, if you have sticky keys turned on but press Super and Tab simultaneously, sticky keys would not wait for you to press another key if you had this option turned on. It would wait if you only pressed one key, however. This is useful if you are able to press some keyboard shortcuts simultaneously (for example, keys that are close together), but not others.
Select Disable if two keys are pressed together to enable this.
You can have the computer make a “beep” sound when you start typing a keyboard shortcut with sticky keys turned on. This is useful if you want to know that sticky keys is expecting a keyboard shortcut to be typed, so the next key press will be interpreted as part of a shortcut. Select Beep when a modifier key is pressed to enable this.
Enable visual alerts to flash the screen or window when an alert sound is played.
Flash the screen for alert sounds
Your computer will play a simple alert sound for certain types of messages and events. If you have a hard time hearing these sounds, you can have either the entire screen or your current window visually flash whenever the alert sound is played.
This can also be useful if you’re in an environment where you need your computer to be silent, such as in a library. See  to learn how to mute the alert sound, then enable visual alerts.
Press Visual Alerts in the Hearing section.
Switch the Visual Alerts switch to on.
Select whether you want the entire screen or just your current window title to flash.
You can quickly turn visual alerts on and off by clicking the accessibility icon on the top bar and selecting Visual Alerts.

Allow applications to access your accounts online for photos, contacts, calendars, and more.
Add an account
Adding an account will help link your online accounts with your GNOME desktop. Thus, your email program, chat program and other related applications will be set up for you.
Open the Activities overview and start typing Online Accounts.
Click on Online Accounts to open the panel.
Select an account from the list on the right.
Select the type of account which you want to add.
A small website window or dialog will open where you can enter your online account credentials. For example, if you are setting up a Google account, enter your Google username and password. Some providers allow you to create a new account from the login dialog.
If you have entered your credentials correctly, you will be prompted to allow GNOME access to your online account. Authorize access to continue.
All services that are offered by an account provider will be enabled by default. Switch individual services to off to disable them.
After you have added accounts, applications can use those accounts for the services you have chosen to allow. See  for information on controlling which services to allow.
Many online services provide an authorization token which GNOME stores instead of your password. If you remove an account, you should also revoke that certificate in the online service. See  for more information.
Some online accounts can be used to access multiple services (like calendar and email). You can control which of these services can be used by applications.
Control which online services an account can be used to access
Some types of online account providers allow you to access several services with the same user account. For example, Google accounts provide access to calendar, email, contacts and chat. You may want to use your account for some services, but not others. For example, you may want to use your Google account for email but not chat if you have a different online account that you use for chat.
You can disable some of the services that are provided by each online account:
Select the account which you want to change from the list on the right.
A list of services that are available with this account will be shown under Use for. See  to see which applications access which services.
Switch off any of the services that you do not want to use.
Once a service has been disabled for an account, applications on your computer will not be able to use the account to connect to that service any more.
To turn on a service that you disabled, just go back to the Online Accounts panel and switch it on.
Baptiste Mille-Mathias
What if an online service provider is not listed?
Why is my account type not on the list?
Support for your favorite online service provider needs someone to develop it. Only the account types that are listed are currently supported.
If you are interested in adding support for other services, contact the developers on the  bug tracker.
Remove access to an online service provider from your applications.
Remove an account
You can remove an online account which you no longer wish to use.
Many online services provide an authorization token which GNOME stores instead of your password. If you remove an account, you should also revoke that certificate in the online service. This will ensure that no other application or website can connect to that service using the authorization for GNOME.
How to revoke the authorization depends on the service provider. Check your settings on the provider’s website for authorized or connected apps or sites. Look for an app called “GNOME” and remove it.
Select the account which you wish to remove.
Click the - button in the lower-left corner of the window.
Click Remove in the confirmation dialog.
Instead of deleting the account completely, it is possible to restrict the services accessed by your desktop.

Applications can use the accounts created in Online Accounts and the services they exploit.
Online services and applications
Once you have added an online account, any application can use that account for any of the available services that you have not disabled. Different providers provide different services. This page lists the different services and some of the applications that are known to use them.
Calendar
The Calendar service allows you to view, add, and edit events in an online calendar. It is used by applications like Calendar, Evolution, and California.
Chat
The Chat service allows you to chat with your contacts on popular instant messaging platforms. It is used by the Empathy application.
Contacts
The Contacts service allows you to see the published details of your contacts on various services. It is used by applications like Contacts and Evolution.
Documents
The Documents service allows you to view your online documents such as those in Google docs. You can view your documents using the Documents application.
Files
The Files service adds a remote file location, as if you had added one using the Connect to Server functionality in the file manager. You can access remote files using the file manager, as well as through file open and save dialogs in any application.
Mail
The Mail service allows you to send and receive email through an email provider like Google. It is used by Evolution.
Photos
The Photos service allows you to view your online photos such as those you post on Facebook. You can view your photos using the Photos application.
Printers
The Printers service allows you to send a PDF copy to a provider from within the print dialog of any application. The provider might provide print services, or it might just serve as storage for the PDF, which you can download and print later.
Read Later
The Read Later service allows you to save a web page to external services so that you can read it later on another device. No applications currently use this service.

Why add your email or social media accounts to your desktop?
Why add an account?
Adding your online accounts brings your choice of services like calendar, chat, and e-mail straight to your desktop and makes the information of the services a seamless part of your user experience. By adding accounts you can easily keep in touch using services from different accounts, like chats, at the same time. Just set up your online accounts once and every time you start your computer all the accounts and services that you have added are ready to use.
See  for information on which applications can access which online services.
Add an online account, Remove an account, Learn about services…
Online accounts
You can enter your login details for some online services, such as Google and Facebook, into the Online Accounts window. This lets you use applications to access online services like email, calendars, chat, and documents.

Verify your backup was successful.
Check your backup
After you have backed up your files, you should make sure that the backup was successful. If it didn’t work properly, you could lose important data since some files could be missing from the backup.
When you use Files to copy or move files, the computer checks to make sure that all of the data transferred correctly. However, if you are transferring data that is very important to you, you may want to perform additional checks to confirm that your data has been transferred properly.
You can do an extra check by looking through the copied files and folders on the destination media. By checking to make sure that the files and folders you transferred are actually there in the backup, you can have extra confidence that the process was successful.
If you find that you do regular backups of large amounts of data, you may find it easier to use a dedicated backup program, such as Déjà Dup. Such a program is more powerful and more reliable than just copying and pasting files.
Tiffany Antopolski
Learn how often you should backup your important files to make sure that they are safe.
Frequency of backups
How often you make backups will depend on the type of data to be backed up. For example, if you are running a network environment with critical data stored on your servers, then even nightly backups may not be enough.
On the other hand, if you are backing up the data on your home computer then hourly backups would likely be unnecessary. You may find it helpful to consider the following points when planning your backup schedule:
The amount of time you spend on the computer.
How often and by how much the data on the computer changes.
If the data you want to back up is lower priority, or subject to few changes, like music, e-mails and family photos, then weekly or even monthly backups may suffice. However, if you happen to be in the middle of a tax audit, more frequent backups may be necessary.
As a general rule, the amount of time in between backups should be no more than the amount of time you are willing to spend re-doing any lost work. For example, if spending a week re-writing lost documents is too long for you, you should back up at least once per week.
Use Déjà Dup (or some other backup application) to make copies of your valuable files and settings to protect against loss.
How to back up
The easiest way of backing up your files and settings is to let a backup application manage the backup process for you. A number of different backup applications are available, for example Déjà Dup.
The help for your chosen backup application will walk you through setting your preferences for the backup, as well as how to restore your data.
An alternative option is to copy your files to a safe location, such as an external hard drive, another computer on the network, or a USB drive. Your personal files and settings are usually in your Home folder, so you can copy them from there.
The amount of data you can back up is limited by the size of the storage device. If you have the room on your backup device, it is best to back up the entire Home folder with the following exceptions:
Files that are already backed up somewhere else, such as to a CD, DVD, or other removable media.
Files that you can recreate easily. For example, if you are a programmer, you do not have to back up the files that get produced when you compile your programs. Instead, just make sure that you back up the original source files.
Any files in the Trash folder. Your Trash folder can be found in /.local/share/Trash.
Retrieve your files from a backup.
Restore a backup
If you lost or deleted some of your files, but you have a backup of them, you can restore them from the backup:
If you want to restore your backup from a device such as external hard drive, USB drive or another computer on the network, you can copy them back to your computer.
If you created your backup using a backup application such as Déjà Dup, it is recommended that you use the same application to restore your backup. Review the application help for your backup program: it will provide specific instructions on how to restore your files.
A list of folders where you can find documents, files and settings that you may want to back up.
Where can I find the files I want to back up?
Deciding which files to back up, and locating them, is the most difficult step when attempting to perform a backup. Listed below are the most common locations of important files and settings that you may want to back up.
Personal files (documents, music, photos and videos)
These are usually stored in your home folder (/home/yourname). They could be in subfolders such as Desktop, Documents, Pictures, Music and Videos.
If your backup medium has sufficient space (if it is an external hard disk, for example), consider backing up the entire Home folder. You can find out how much disk space your Home folder takes up by using the Disk Usage Analyzer.
Hidden files
View options
Any file or folder name that starts with a period (.) is hidden by default. To view hidden files, click the  button in the toolbar, and then choose Show Hidden Files, or press CtrlH. You can copy these to a backup location like any other file.
Personal settings (desktop preferences, themes, and software settings)
Most applications store their settings in hidden folders inside your Home folder (see above for information on hidden files).
Most of your application settings will be stored in the hidden folders .config and .local in your Home folder.
System-wide settings
Settings for important parts of the system are not stored in your Home folder. There are a number of locations that they could be stored, but most are stored in the /etc folder. In general, you will not need to back up these files on a home computer. If you are running a server, however, you should back up the files for the services that it is running.
Back up anything that you cannot bear to lose if something goes wrong.
What to back up
Your priority should be to back up your most important files as well as those that are difficult to recreate. For example, ranked from most important to least important:
Your personal files
This may include documents, spreadsheets, email, calendar appointments, financial data, family photos, or any other personal files that you would consider irreplaceable.
Your personal settings
This includes changes you may have made to colors, backgrounds, screen resolution and mouse settings on your desktop. This also includes application preferences, such as settings for LibreOffice, your music player, and your email program. These are replaceable, but may take a while to recreate.
System settings
Most people never change the system settings that are created during installation. If you do customize your system settings for some reason, or if you use your computer as a server, then you may wish to back up these settings.
Installed software
The software you use can normally be restored quite quickly after a serious computer problem by reinstalling it.
In general, you will want to back up files that are irreplaceable and files that require a great time investment to replace without a backup. If things are easy to replace, on the other hand, you may not want to use up disk space by having backups of them.
c
Advice on where to store your backups and what type of storage device to use.
Where to store your backup
You should store backup copies of your files somewhere separate from your computer — on an external hard disk, for example. That way, if the computer breaks, the backup will still be intact. For maximum security, you shouldn’t keep the backup in the same building as your computer. If there is a fire or theft, both copies of the data could be lost if they are kept together.
It is important to choose an appropriate backup medium too. You need to store your backups on a device that has sufficient disk capacity for all of the backed-up files.
Local and remote storage options
USB memory key (low capacity)
Internal disk drive (high capacity)
External hard disk (typically high capacity)
Network-connected drive (high capacity)
File/backup server (high capacity)
Writable CDs or DVDs (low/medium capacity)
Online backup service (Amazon S3, for example; capacity depends on price)
Some of these options have sufficient capacity to allow for a backup of every file on your system, also known as a complete system backup.
Backups
Why, what, where and how of backups.
Back up your important files
Backing up your files simply means making a copy of them for safekeeping. This is done in case the original files become unusable due to loss or corruption. These copies can be used to restore the original data in the event of loss. Copies should be stored on a different device from the original files. For example, you may use a USB drive, an external hard drive, a CD/DVD, or an off-site service.
The best way to back up your files is to do so regularly, keeping the copies off-site and (possibly) encrypted.

Pair Bluetooth devices.
Connect your computer to a Bluetooth device
Before you can use a Bluetooth device like a mouse or a headset, you first need to connect your computer to the device. This is also called pairing the Bluetooth devices.
Open the Activities overview and start typing Bluetooth.
Click on Bluetooth to open the panel.
Make sure Bluetooth is enabled: the switch at the top should be set to on. With the panel open and the switch on, your computer will begin searching for devices.
Make the other Bluetooth device discoverable or visible and place it within 5-10 meters (about 16-33 feet) of your computer.
Click the device in the Devices list. The panel for the device will open.
If required, confirm the PIN on your other device. The device should show you the PIN you see on your computer screen. Confirm the PIN on the device (you may need to click Pair or Confirm), then click Confirm on the computer.
You need to finish your entry within about 20 seconds on most devices, or the connection will not be completed. If that happens, return to the device list and start again.
The entry for the device in the Devices list will show a Connected status.
To edit the device, click on it in the Device list. You will see a panel specific to the device. It may display additional options applicable to the type of device to which you are connecting.
Close the panel once you have changed the settings.
The Bluetooth icon on the top bar
When one or more Bluetooth devices are connected, the Bluetooth icon appears in the system status area.

How to pair specific devices with your computer.
Pairing instructions for specific devices
Even if you manage to source the manual for a device, it might not contain enough information to make pairing possible. Here are details for a few common devices.
PlayStation 3 joypads
Those devices use “cable-pairing”. Plug the joypads in via USB with the Bluetooth Settings opened, and Bluetooth turned on. After pressing the “PS” button, you will get asked whether to set those joypads up. Unplug them and press the “PS” button to use them over Bluetooth.
PlayStation 4 joypads
Those devices use “cable-pairing” as well. Plug the joypads in via USB with the Bluetooth Settings opened, and Bluetooth turned on. You will get asked whether to set those joypads up without needing to press the PS button. Unplug them and press the PS button to use them over Bluetooth.
Using the “PS” and “Share” button combination to pair the joypad can also be used to make the joypad visible and pair it like any other Bluetooth device, if you don’t have a USB cable at hand.
PlayStation 3 BD Remote Control
Hold the “Start” and “Enter” buttons at the same time for around 5 seconds. You can then select the remote in the devices list as usual.
Nintendo Wii and Wii U Remotes
Use the red “Sync” button inside the battery compartment to start the pairing process. Other button combinations will not keep pairing information, so you would need to do it all over again in short order. Also note that some software wants direct access to the remotes, and, in those cases, you should not set them up in the Bluetooth panel. Refer to the application’s manual for instructions.
The adapter could be turned off or may not have drivers, or Bluetooth might be disabled or blocked.
I cannot connect my Bluetooth device
There are a number of reasons why you may not be able to connect to a Bluetooth device, such as a phone or headset.
Connection blocked or untrusted
Some Bluetooth devices block connections by default, or require you to change a setting to allow connections to be made. Make sure that your device is set up to allow connections.
Bluetooth hardware not recognized
Your Bluetooth adapter or dongle may not have been recognized by the computer. This could be because drivers for the adapter are not installed. Some Bluetooth adapters are not supported on Linux, so you may not be able to get the right drivers for them. In this case, you will probably have to get a different Bluetooth adapter.
Adapter is not switched on
Make sure that your Bluetooth adapter is switched on. Open the Bluetooth panel and check that it is not disabled.
Device Bluetooth connection switched off
Check that Bluetooth is turned on on the device you are trying to connect to, and that it is discoverable or visible. For example, if you are trying to connect to a phone, make sure that it is not in airplane mode.
No Bluetooth adapter in your computer
Many computers do not have Bluetooth adapters. You can buy an adapter if you want to use Bluetooth.
Remove a device from the list of Bluetooth devices.
Disconnect a Bluetooth device
If you do not want to be connected to a Bluetooth device anymore, you can remove the connection. This is useful if you no longer want to use a device like a mouse or headset, or if you no longer wish to transfer files to or from a device.
Select the device which you want to disconnect from the list.
In the device dialog box, switch the Connection switch to off, or to remove the device from the Devices list, click Remove Device.
You can reconnect a Bluetooth device later if desired.
Share files to Bluetooth devices such as your phone.
Send files to a Bluetooth device
You can send files to connected Bluetooth devices, such as some mobile phones or other computers. Some types of devices do not allow the transfer of files, or specific types of files. You can send files using the Bluetooth settings window.
Send Files does not work on unsupported devices such as iPhones.
Make sure Bluetooth is enabled: the switch in the titlebar should be set to on.
In the Devices list, select the device to which to send the files. If the desired device is not shown as Connected in the list, you need to connect to it.
A panel specific to the external device appears.
Click Send Files… and the file chooser will appear.
Choose the file you want to send and click Select.
To send more than one file in a folder, hold down Ctrl as you select each file.
The owner of the receiving device usually has to press a button to accept the file. The Bluetooth File Transfer dialog will show the progress bar. Click Close when the transfer is complete.

You can turn Bluetooth on to connect to other Bluetooth devices, or turn it off to conserve power. To turn Bluetooth on:
Set the switch at the top to on.
Many laptop computers have a hardware switch or key combination to turn Bluetooth on and off. Look for a switch on your computer or a key on your keyboard. The keyboard key is often accessed with the help of the Fn key.
To turn Bluetooth off:
Open the system menu from the right side of the top bar.
Select  Not In Use. The Bluetooth section of the menu will expand.
Select Turn Off.
Your computer is visible as long as the Bluetooth panel is open.
Whether other devices can discover your computer.
What is Bluetooth visibility?
Bluetooth visibility refers to whether other devices can discover your computer when searching for Bluetooth devices. When Bluetooth is turned on and the Bluetooth panel is open, your computer will advertise itself to all other devices within range, allowing them to attempt to connect to your computer.
You can change the name your computer displays to other devices.
After you have connected to a device, neither your computer nor the device needs to be visible to communicate with each other.
Devices without a display usually have a pairing mode that can be entered by pressing a button, or a combination of buttons for a while, whether when they’ve already been turned on, or as they are being turned on.
The best way to find out how to enter that mode is to refer to the device’s manual. For some devices, the procedure might be slightly different from usual.

Why is this important, Color profiles, How to calibrate a device…
Color management
Color profiles
Calibration
Look in SettingsColor to add a color profile for your screen.
How do I assign profiles to devices?
You may want to assign a color profile for your screen or printer so that the colors which it shows are more accurate.
Click Devices in the sidebar.
Click Color in the sidebar to open the panel.
Select the device for which you want to add a profile.
Click Add profile to select an existing profile or import a new profile.
Press Add to confirm your selection.
Each device can have multiple profiles assigned to it, but only one profile can be the default profile. The default profile is used when there is no extra information to allow the profile to be chosen automatically. An example of this automatic selection would be if one profile was created for glossy paper and another plain paper.
If calibration hardware is connected, the Calibrate… button will create a new profile.
Calibrating your camera is important to capture accurate colors.
How do I calibrate my camera?
Camera devices are calibrated by taking a photograph of a target under the desired lighting conditions. By converting the RAW file to a TIFF file, it can be used to calibrate the camera device in the color control panel.
You will need to crop the TIFF file so that just the target is visible. Ensure the white or black borders are still visible. Calibration will not work if the image is upside-down or is distorted by a large amount.
The resulting profile is only valid under the lighting condition that you acquired the original image from. This means you might need to profile several times for studio, bright sunlight and cloudy lighting conditions.
Calibrating your printer is important to print accurate colors.
How do I calibrate my printer?
There are two ways to profile a printer device:
Using a photospectrometer device like the Pantone ColorMunki
Downloading a printing a reference file from a color company
Using a color company to generate a printer profile is usually the cheapest option if you only have one or two different paper types. By downloading the reference chart from the companies website you can then send them back the print in a padded envelope where they will scan the paper, generate the profile and email you back an accurate ICC profile.
Using an expensive device such as a ColorMunki works out cheaper only if you are profiling a large number of ink sets or paper types.
If you change your ink supplier, make sure you recalibrate the printer!
Calibrating your scanner is important to capture accurate colors.
How do I calibrate my scanner?
If you want your scanner to represent the color accurately in scans, you should calibrate it.
Make sure your scanner is connected to your computer with a cable or over the network.
Scan your calibration target and save it as an uncompressed TIFF file.
Select your scanner.
Press Calibrate… to commence the calibration.
Scanner devices are incredibly stable over time and temperature, so do not usually need to be recalibrated.
Calibrating your screen is important to display accurate colors.
How do I calibrate my screen?
You can calibrate your screen so that it shows more accurate color. This is especially useful if you are involved in digital photography, design or artwork.
You will need either a colorimeter or a spectrophotometer to do this. Both devices are used to profile screens, but they work in slightly different ways.
Make sure your calibration device is connected to your computer.
Select your screen.
Screens change all the time: the backlight in a TFT display will halve in brightness approximately every 18 months, and will get yellower as it gets older. This means you should recalibrate your screen when the [!] icon appears in the Color panel.
LED screens also change over time, but a much slower rate than TFTs.
Calibration and characterization are different things entirely.
What’s the difference between calibration and characterization?
Many people are initially confused about the difference between calibration and characterization. Calibration is the process of modifying the color behavior of a device. This is typically done using two mechanisms:
Changing controls or internal settings that it has
Applying curves to its color channels
The idea of calibration is to put a device in a defined state with regard to its color response. Often this is used as a day to day means of maintaining reproducible behavior. Typically calibration will be stored in device or systems specific file formats that record the device settings or per-channel calibration curves.
Characterization (or profiling) is recording the way a device reproduces or responds to color. Typically the result is stored in a device ICC profile. Such a profile does not in itself modify color in any way. It allows a system such as a CMM (Color Management Module) or a color aware application to modify color when combined with another device profile. Only by knowing the characteristics of two devices, can a way of transferring color from one device representation to another be achieved.
Note that a characterization (profile) will only be valid for a device if it’s in the same state of calibration as it was when it was characterized.
In the case of display profiles there is some additional confusion because often the calibration information is stored in the profile for convenience. By convention it is stored in a tag called the vcgt tag. Although it is stored in the profile, none of the normal ICC based tools or applications are aware of it, or do anything with it. Similarly, typical display calibration tools and applications will not be aware of, or do anything with the ICC characterization (profile) information.
We support a large number of calibration devices.
What color measuring instruments are supported?
GNOME relies on the Argyll color management system to support color instruments. Thus the following display measuring instruments are supported:
Gretag-Macbeth i1 Pro (spectrometer)
Gretag-Macbeth i1 Monitor (spectrometer)
Gretag-Macbeth i1 Display 1, 2 or LT (colorimeter)
X-Rite i1 Display Pro (colorimeter)
X-Rite ColorMunki Design or Photo (spectrometer)
X-Rite ColorMunki Create (colorimeter)
X-Rite ColorMunki Display (colorimeter)
Pantone Huey (colorimeter)
MonacoOPTIX (colorimeter)
ColorVision Spyder 2 and 3 (colorimeter)
Colorimètre HCFR (colorimeter)
The Pantone Huey is currently the cheapest and best supported hardware in Linux.
Thanks to Argyll there’s also a number of spot and strip reading reflective spectrometers supported to help you calibrating and characterizing your printers:
X-Rite DTP20 “Pulse” (“swipe” type reflective spectrometer)
X-Rite DTP22 Digital Swatchbook (spot type reflective spectrometer)
X-Rite DTP41 (spot and strip reading reflective spectrometer)
X-Rite DTP41T (spot and strip reading reflective spectrometer)
X-Rite DTP51 (spot reading reflective spectrometer)
Calibration targets are needed to do scanner and camera profiling.
Which target types are supported?
The following types of targets are supported:
CMP DigitalTarget
ColorChecker 24
ColorChecker DC
ColorChecker SG
i1 RGB Scan 14
LaserSoft DC Pro
QPcard 201
IT8.7/2
You can purchase targets from well-known vendors like KODAK, X-Rite and LaserSoft in various online shops.
Alternatively you can buy targets from Wolf Faust at a very fair price.
Sharing color profiles is never a good idea as hardware changes over time.
Can I share my color profile?
Color profiles that you have created yourself are specific to the hardware and lighting conditions that you calibrated for. A display that has been powered for a few hundred hours is going to have a very different color profile to a similar display with the next serial number that has been lit for a thousand hours.
This means if you share your color profile with somebody, you might be getting them closer to calibration, but it’s misleading at best to say that their display is calibrated.
Similarly, unless everyone has recommended controlled lighting (no sunlight from windows, black walls, daylight bulbs etc.) in a room where viewing and editing images takes place, sharing a profile that you created in your own specific lighting conditions doesn’t make a lot of sense.
You should carefully check the redistribution conditions for profiles downloaded from vendor websites or that were created on your behalf.
Color profiles are provided by vendors and can be generated yourself.
Where do I get color profiles?
The best way to get profiles is to generate them yourself, although this does require some initial outlay.
Many manufacturers do try to provide color profiles for devices, although sometimes they are wrapped up in driver bundles which you may need to download, extract and then search for the color profiles.
Some manufacturers do not provide accurate profiles for the hardware and the profiles are best avoided. A good clue is to download the profile, and if the creation date is more than a year before the date you bought the device then it’s likely dummy data generated that is useless.
See  for information on why vendor-supplied profiles are often worse than useless.
Color profiles can be imported by opening them.
How do I import color profiles?
You can import a color profile by double clicking on a .ICC or .ICM file in the file browser.
Alternatively you can manage your color profiles through the Color panel.
Select your device.
The manufacturer of your display may supply a profile that you can use. These profiles are usually made for the average display, so may not be perfect for your specific one. For the best calibration, you should create your own profile using a colorimeter or a spectrophotometer.
Whole-screen color correction modifies all the screen colors on all windows.
Missing information for whole-screen color correction?
Unfortunately, many vendor-supplied ICC profiles do not include the information required for whole-screen color correction. These profiles can still be useful for applications that can do color compensation, but you will not see all the colors of your screen change.
In order to create a display profile, which includes both calibration and characterization data, you will need to use a special color measuring instruments called a colorimeter or a spectrometer.
You can be notified if your color profile is old and inaccurate.
Can I get notified when my color profile is inaccurate?
You can be reminded to recalibrate your devices after a specific period of time. Unfortunately, it is not possible to tell without recalibrating whether a device profile is accurate, so it is best to recalibrate devices regularly.
Some companies have very specific calibration expiry policies for profiles, as an inaccurate color profile can make a huge difference to an end product.
If you set the timeout policy and a profile is older than the policy then a red warning triangle will be shown in the Color panel next to the profile. A warning notification will also be shown every time you log into your computer.
To set the policy for display and printer devices, you specify the maximum age of the profile in days:
Default monitor profiles do not have a calibration date.
Why don’t the default monitor profiles have a calibration expiry?
The default color profile used for each monitor is generated automatically based on the display  EDID which is stored in a memory chip inside the monitor. The EDID only gives us a snapshot of the available colors the monitor was capable of displaying when it was manufactured, and does not contain much other information for color correction.
As the EDID cannot be updated, it has no expiry date.
external ref='figures/color-profile-default.png' md5='2cabb46bf9cf9dc5476c7f6c27a7f3a5'
Getting a profile from the monitor vendor or creating a profile yourself would lead to more accurate color correction.
Use the supplied test profiles to check that your profiles are being applied correctly to your screen.
How do I test if color management is working correctly?
The effects of a color profile are sometimes subtle and it may be hard to see if anything much has changed.
GNOME comes with several profiles for testing that make it very clear when the profiles are being applied:
Blue
This will turn the screen blue and tests if the calibration curves are being sent to the display.
Select the device for which you want to add a profile. You may wish to make a note of which profile is currently being used.
Click Add profile to select a test profile, which should be at the bottom of the list.
To revert to your previous profile, select the device in the Color panel, then select the profile that you were using before you tried one of the test profiles and press Enable to use it again.
Using these profiles, you can clearly see when an application supports color management.
A color profile is a simple file that expresses a color space or device response.
What is a color profile?
A color profile is a set of data that characterizes either a device such as a projector or a color space such as sRGB.
Most color profiles are in the form of an ICC profile, which is a small file with a .ICC or .ICM file extension.
Color profiles can be embedded into images to specify the gamut range of the data. This ensures that users see the same colors on different devices.
Every device that is processing color should have its own ICC profile and when this is achieved the system is said to have an end-to-end color-managed workflow. With this kind of workflow you can be sure that colors are not being lost or modified.
A color space is a defined range of colors.
What is a color space?
A color space is a defined range of colors. Well known color spaces include sRGB, AdobeRGB and ProPhotoRGB.
The human visual system is not a simple RGB sensor, but we can approximate how the eye responds with a CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram that shows the human visual response as a horse-shoe shape. You can see that in human vision there are many more shades of green detected than blue or red. With a trichromatic color space like RGB we represent the colors on the computer using three values, which restricts up to encoding a triangle of colors.
Using models such as a CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram is a huge simplification of the human visual system, and real gamuts are expressed as 3D hulls, rather than 2D projections. A 2D projection of a 3D shape can sometimes be misleading, so if you want to see the 3D hull, use the gcm-viewer application.
sRGB, AdobeRGB and ProPhotoRGB represented by white triangles
First, looking at sRGB, which is the smallest space and can encode the least number of colors. It is an approximation of a 10 year old CRT display, and so most modern monitors can easily display more colors than this. sRGB is a least-common-denominator standard and is used in a large number of applications (including the Internet).
AdobeRGB is frequently used as an editing space. It can encode more colors than sRGB, which means you can change colors in a photograph without worrying too much that the most vivid colors are being clipped or the blacks crushed.
ProPhoto is the largest space available and is frequently used for document archival. It can encode nearly the whole range of colors detected by the human eye, and even encode colors that the eye cannot detect!
Now, if ProPhoto is clearly better, why don’t we use it for everything? The answer is to do with quantization. If you only have 8 bits (256 levels) to encode each channel, then a larger range is going to have bigger steps between each value.
Bigger steps mean a larger error between the captured color and the stored color, and for some colors this is a big problem. It turns out that key colors, like skin colors are very important, and even small errors will make untrained viewers notice that something in a photograph looks wrong.
Of course, using a 16 bit image is going to leave many more steps and a much smaller quantization error, but this doubles the size of each image file. Most content in existence today is 8bpp, i.e. 8 bits-per-pixel.
Color management is a process for converting from one color space to another, where a color space can be a well known defined space like sRGB, or a custom space such as your monitor or printer profile.
Calibrating is important if you care about the colors you display or print.
Why do I need to do calibration myself?
Generic profiles are usually bad. When a manufacturer creates a new model, they just take a few items from the production line and average them together:
Averaged profiles
Display panels differ quite a lot from unit to unit and change substantially as the display ages. It is also more difficult for printers, as just changing the type or weight of paper can invalidate the characterization state and make the profile inaccurate.
The best way of ensuring the profile you have is accurate is by doing the calibration yourself, or by letting an external company supply you with a profile based on your exact characterization state.
Color management is important for designers, photographers and artists.
Why is color management important?
Color management is the process of capturing a color using an input device, displaying it on a screen, and printing it all whilst managing the exact colors and the range of colors on each medium.
The need for color management is probably explained best with a photograph of a bird on a frosty day in winter.
A bird on a frosty wall as seen on the camera view-finder
Displays typically over-saturate the blue channel, making the images look cold.
This is what the user sees on a typical business laptop screen
Notice how the white is not “paper white” and the black of the eye is now a muddy brown.
This is what the user sees when printing on a typical inkjet printer
The basic problem we have here is that each device is capable of handling a different range of colors. So while you might be able to take a photo of electric blue, most printers are not going to be able to reproduce it.
Most image devices capture in RGB (Red, Green, Blue) and have to convert to CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black) to print. Another problem is that you can’t have white ink, and so the whiteness can only be as good as the paper color.
Another problem is units. Without specifying the scale on which a color is measured, we don’t know if 100% red is near infrared or just the deepest red ink in the printer. What is 50% red on one display is probably something like 62% on another display. It’s like telling a person that you’ve just driven 7 units of distance, without the unit you don’t know if that’s 7 kilometers or 7 meters.
In color, we refer to the units as gamut. Gamut is essentially the range of colors that can be reproduced. A device like a DSLR camera might have a very large gamut, being able to capture all the colors in a sunset, but a projector has a very small gamut and all the colors are going to look “washed out”.
In some cases we can correct the device output by altering the data we send to it, but in other cases where that’s not possible (you can’t print electric blue) we need to show the user what the result is going to look like.
For photographs it makes sense to use the full tonal range of a color device, to be able to make smooth changes in color. For other graphics, you might want to match the color exactly, which is important if you’re trying to print a custom mug with the Red Hat logo that has to be the exact Red Hat Red.

Test the performance of your hard disk
To test the speed of your hard disk:
Open Disks from the Activities overview.
Choose the disk from the list in the left pane.
Click the menu button and select Benchmark disk… from the menu.
Click Start Benchmark… and adjust the Transfer Rate and Access Time parameters as desired.
Click Start Benchmarking to test how fast data can be read from the disk. Administrative privileges may be required. Enter your password, or the password for the requested administrator account.
If Perform write-benchmark is checked, the benchmark will test how fast data can be read from and written to the disk. This will take longer to complete.
When the test is finished, the results will appear on the graph. The green points and connecting lines indicate the samples taken; these correspond to the right axis, showing access time, plotted against the bottom axis, representing percentage time elapsed during the benchmark. The blue line represents read rates, while the red line represents write rates; these are shown as access data rates on the left axis, plotted against percentage of the disk traveled, from the outside to the spindle, along the bottom axis.
Below the graph, values are displayed for minimum, maximum and average read and write rates, average access time and time elapsed since the last benchmark test.

What if the disk is too full?
If the disk is too full you should:
Delete files that aren’t important or that you won’t use anymore.
Make backups of the important files that you won’t need for a while and delete them from the hard drive.
Test your hard disk for problems to make sure that it’s healthy.
Check your hard disk for problems
Checking the hard disk
Hard disks have a built-in health-check tool called SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology), which continually checks the disk for potential problems. SMART also warns you if the disk is about to fail, helping you avoid loss of important data.
Although SMART runs automatically, you can also check your disk’s health by running the Disks application:
Check your disk’s health using the Disks application
Open Disks from the Activities overview.
Select the disk you want to check from the list of storage devices on the left. Information and status of the disk will be shown.
See more information under SMART Attributes, or click the Start Self-test button to run a self-test.
What if the disk isn’t healthy?
Even if the Overall Assessment indicates that the disk isn’t healthy, there may be no cause for alarm. However, it’s better to be prepared with a backup to prevent data loss.
If the status says “Pre-fail”, the disk is still reasonably healthy but signs of wear have been detected which mean it might fail in the near future. If your hard disk (or computer) is a few years old, you are likely to see this message on at least some of the health checks. You should backup your important files regularly and check the disk status periodically to see if it gets worse.
If it gets worse, you may wish to take the computer/hard disk to a professional for further diagnosis or repair.
Remove all of the files and folders from an external hard disk or USB flash drive by formatting it.
Wipe everything off a removable disk
If you have a removable disk, like a USB memory stick or an external hard disk, you may sometimes wish to completely remove all of its files and folders. You can do this by formatting the disk — this deletes all of the files on the disk and leaves it empty.
Format a removable disk
Select the disk you want to wipe from the list of storage devices on the left.
Make sure that you have selected the correct disk! If you choose the wrong disk, all of the files on the other disk will be deleted!
In the toolbar underneath the Volumes section, click the menu button. Then click Format….
In the window that pops up, choose a file system Type for the disk.
If you use the disk on Windows and Mac OS computers in addition to Linux computers, choose FAT. If you only use it on Windows, NTFS may be a better option. A brief description of the file system type will be presented as a label.
Give the disk a name and click Format… to continue and show a confirmation window. Check the details carefully, and click Format to wipe the disk.
Once the formatting has finished, click the eject icon to safely remove the disk. It should now be blank and ready to use again.
Formatting a disk does not securely delete your files
Formatting a disk is not a completely secure way of wiping all of its data. A formatted disk will not appear to have files on it, but it is possible that special recovery software could retrieve the files. If you need to securely delete the files, you will need to use a command-line utility, such as shred.
Understand what volumes and partitions are and use the disk utility to manage them.
Manage volumes and partitions
The word volume is used to describe a storage device, like a hard disk. It can also refer to a part of the storage on that device, because you can split the storage up into chunks. The computer makes this storage accessible via your file system in a process referred to as mounting. Mounted volumes may be hard drives, USB drives, DVD-RWs, SD cards, and other media. If a volume is currently mounted, you can read (and possibly write) files on it.
Often, a mounted volume is called a partition, though they are not necessarily the same thing. A “partition” refers to a physical area of storage on a single disk drive. Once a partition has been mounted, it can be referred to as a volume because you can access the files on it. You can think of volumes as the labeled, accessible “storefronts” to the functional “back rooms” of partitions and drives.
View and manage volumes and partitions using the disk utility
You can check and modify your computer’s storage volumes with the disk utility.
Open the Activities overview and start Disks.
In the list of storage devices on the left, you will find hard disks, CD/DVD drives, and other physical devices. Click the device you want to inspect.
The right pane provides a visual breakdown of the volumes and partitions present on the selected device. It also contains a variety of tools used to manage these volumes.
Be careful: it is possible to completely erase the data on your disk with these utilities.
Your computer most likely has at least one primary partition and a single swap partition. The swap partition is used by the operating system for memory management, and is rarely mounted. The primary partition contains your operating system, applications, settings, and personal files. These files can also be distributed among multiple partitions for security or convenience.
One primary partition must contain information that your computer uses to start up, or boot. For this reason it is sometimes called a boot partition, or boot volume. To determine if a volume is bootable, select the partition and click the menu button in the toolbar underneath the partition list. Then, click Edit Partition… and look at its Flags. External media such as USB drives and CDs may also contain a bootable volume.
Check if a filesystem is damaged and bring it back into a usable state.
Repair a damaged filesystem
Filesystems can be corrupted due to unexpected power loss, system crashes and unsafe removal of the drive. After such an incident it is recommended to repair or at least check the filesystem to prevent future data loss.
Sometimes a repair is required in order to mount or modify a filesystem. Even if a check does not report any damage the filesystem might still be marked as ‘dirty’ internally and require a repair.
Check if a filesystem is damaged
Select the disk containing the filesystem in question from the list of storage devices on the left. If there is more than one volume on the disk, select the volume which contains the filesystem.
In the toolbar underneath the Volumes section, click the menu button. Then click Check Filesystem….
Depending on how much data is stored in the filesystem a check may take longer time. Confirm to start the action in the dialog that pops up.
The action will not modify the filesystem but will unmount it if needed. Be patient while the filesystem is checked.
After completion you will be notified whether the filesystem is damaged. Note that in some cases even if the filesystem is undamaged it still may need to be repaired to reset an internal ‘dirty’ marker.
Possible data loss when repairing
If the filesystem structure is damaged it can affect the files stored in it. In some cases these files can not be brought into a valid form again and will be deleted or moved to a special directory. It is normally the lost+found folder in the top level directory of the filesystem where these recovered file parts can be found.
If the data is too valuable to be lost during this process, you are advised to back it up by saving an image of the volume before repairing.
This image can be then processed with forensic analysis tools like sleuthkit to further recover missing files and data parts which were not restored during the repair, and also previously removed files.
Repair a filesystem
In the toolbar underneath the Volumes section, click the menu button. Then click Repair Filesystem….
Depending on how much data is stored in the filesystem a repair may take longer time. Confirm to start the action in the dialog that pops up.
The action will unmount the filesystem if needed. The repair action tries to bring the filesystem into a consistent state and moves files which were damaged in a special folder. Be patient while the filesystem is repaired.
After completion you will be notified whether the filesystem could be successfully repaired. In case of success it can be used again in the normal way.
If the filesystem could not be repaired, back it up by saving an image of the volume to be able to retrieve important files later. This can be done by mounting the image read-only or using forensic analysis tools like sleuthkit.
To make use of the volume again it has to be formatted with a new filesystem. All data will be discarded.
Shrink or grow a filesystem and its partition.
Adjust the size of a filesystem
A filesystem can be grown to make use of the free space after its partition. Often this is even possible while the filesystem is mounted.
To make space for another partition after the filesystem, it can be shrunk according to the free space within it.
Not all filesystems have resize support.
The partition size will be changed together with the filesystem size. It is also possible to resize a partition without a filesystem in the same way.
Resize a filesystem/partition
In the toolbar underneath the Volumes section, click the menu button. Then click Resize Filesystem… or Resize… if there is no filesystem.
A dialog will open where the new size can be chosen. The filesystem will be mounted to calculate the minimum size by the amount of current content. If shrinking is not supported the minimum size is the current size. Leave enough space within the filesystem when shrinking to ensure that it can work fast and reliably.
Depending on how much data has to be moved from the shrunk part, the filesystem resize may take longer time.
The filesystem resize automatically involves repairing of the filesystem. Therefore it is advised to back up important data before starting. The action must not be stopped or it will result in a damaged filesystem.
Confirm to start the action by clicking Resize.
The action will unmount the filesystem if resizing a mounted filesystem is not supported. Be patient while the filesystem is resized.
After completion of the needed resize and repair actions the filesystem is ready to be used again.

Automatically run applications for CDs and DVDs, cameras, audio players, and other devices and media.
Open applications for devices or discs
You can have an application automatically start when you plug in a device or insert a disc or media card. For example, you might want your photo organizer to start when you plug in a digital camera. You can also turn this off, so that nothing happens when you plug something in.
To decide which applications should start when you plug in various devices:
Open the Activities overview and start typing Details.
Click on Details to open the panel.
Click Removable Media.
Find your desired device or media type, and then choose an application or action for that media type. See below for a description of the different types of devices and media.
Instead of starting an application, you can also set it so that the device will be shown in the file manager, with the Open folder option. When that happens, you will be asked what to do, or nothing will happen automatically.
If you do not see the device or media type that you want to change in the list (such as Blu-ray discs or E-book readers), click Other Media… to see a more detailed list of devices. Select the type of device or media from the Type drop-down and the application or action from the Action drop-down.
If you do not want any applications to be opened automatically, whatever you plug in, select Never prompt or start programs on media insertion at the bottom of the Details window.
Types of devices and media
Audio discs
Choose your favorite music application or CD audio extractor to handle audio CDs. If you use audio DVDs (DVD-A), select how to open them under Other Media…. If you open an audio disc with the file manager, the tracks will appear as WAV files that you can play in any audio player application.
Video discs
Choose your favorite video application to handle video DVDs. Use the Other Media… button to set an application for Blu-ray, HD DVD, video CD (VCD), and super video CD (SVCD). If DVDs or other video discs do not work correctly when you insert them, see .
Blank discs
Use the Other Media… button to select a disc-writing application for blank CDs, blank DVDs, blank Blu-ray discs, and blank HD DVDs.
Cameras and photos
Use the Photos drop-down to choose a photo-management application to run when you plug in your digital camera, or when you insert a media card from a camera, such as a CF, SD, MMC, or MS card. You can also simply browse your photos using the file manager.
Under Other Media…, you can select an application to open Kodak picture CDs, such as those you might have made in a store. These are regular data CDs with JPEG images in a folder called Pictures.
Music players
Choose an application to manage the music library on your portable music player, or manage the files yourself using the file manager.
E-book readers
Use the Other Media… button to choose an application to manage the books on your e-book reader, or manage the files yourself using the file manager.
Software
Some discs and removable media contain software that is supposed to be run automatically when the media is inserted. Use the Software option to control what to do when media with autorun software is inserted. You will always be prompted for a confirmation before software is run.
Never run software from media you don’t trust.
Manage and organize files with the file manager.
Browse files and folders
Use the Files file manager to browse and organize the files on your computer. You can also use it to manage files on storage devices (like external hard disks), on file servers, and on network shares.
To start the file manager, open Files in the Activities overview. You can also search for files and folders through the overview in the same way you would search for applications.
Exploring the contents of folders
In the file manager, double-click any folder to view its contents, and double-click or middle-click any file to open it with the default application for that file. Middle-click a folder to open it in a new tab. You can also right-click a folder to open it in a new tab or new window.
When looking through the files in a folder, you can quickly preview each file by pressing the space bar to be sure you have the right file before opening it, copying it, or deleting it.
The path bar above the list of files and folders shows you which folder you’re viewing, including the parent folders of the current folder. Click a parent folder in the path bar to go to that folder. Right-click any folder in the path bar to open it in a new tab or window, or access its properties.
If you want to quickly search for a file, in or below the folder you are viewing, start typing its name. A search bar will appear at the top of the window and only files which match your search will be shown. Press Esc to cancel the search.
You can quickly access common places from the sidebar. If you do not see the sidebar, press the menu button in the top-right corner of the window and then select Sidebar. You can add bookmarks to folders that you use often and they will appear in the sidebar. Drag a folder to the sidebar, and drop it over New bookmark, which appears dynamically, or click the current folder in the path bar and then select Add to Bookmarks.

Copy or move items to a new folder.
Copy or move files and folders
A file or folder can be copied or moved to a new location by dragging and dropping with the mouse, using the copy and paste commands, or by using keyboard shortcuts.
For example, you might want to copy a presentation onto a memory stick so you can take it to work with you. Or, you could make a back-up copy of a document before you make changes to it (and then use the old copy if you don’t like your changes).
These instructions apply to both files and folders. You copy and move files and folders in exactly the same way.
Copy and paste files
Select the file you want to copy by clicking on it once.
Right-click and pick Copy, or press CtrlC.
Navigate to another folder, where you want to put the copy of the file.
Click the menu button and pick Paste to finish copying the file, or press CtrlV. There will now be a copy of the file in the original folder and the other folder.
Cut and paste files to move them
Select the file you want to move by clicking on it once.
Right-click and pick Cut, or press CtrlX.
Navigate to another folder, where you want to move the file.
Click the menu button in the toolbar and pick Paste to finish moving the file, or press CtrlV. The file will be taken out of its original folder and moved to the other folder.
Drag files to copy or move
Open the file manager and go to the folder which contains the file you want to copy.
Click Files in the top bar, select New Window (or press CtrlN) to open a second window. In the new window, navigate to the folder where you want to move or copy the file.
Click and drag the file from one window to another. This will move it if the destination is on the same device, or copy it if the destination is on a different device.
For example, if you drag a file from a USB memory stick to your Home folder, it will be copied, because you’re dragging from one device to another.
You can force the file to be copied by holding down the Ctrl key while dragging, or force it to be moved by holding down the Shift key while dragging.
You cannot copy or move a file into a folder that is read-only. Some folders are read-only to prevent you from making changes to their contents. You can change things from being read-only by changing file permissions .
Remove files or folders you no longer need.
Delete files and folders
If you do not want a file or folder any more, you can delete it. When you delete an item it is moved to the Trash folder, where it is stored until you empty the trash. You can restore items in the Trash folder to their original location if you decide you need them, or if they were accidentally deleted.
To send a file to the trash:
Select the item you want to place in the trash by clicking it once.
Press Delete on your keyboard. Alternatively, drag the item to the Trash in the sidebar.
The file will be moved to the trash, and you’ll be presented with an option to Undo the deletion. The Undo button will appear for a few seconds. If you select Undo, the file will be restored to its original location.
To delete files permanently, and free up disk space on your computer, you need to empty the trash. To empty the trash, right-click Trash in the sidebar and select Empty Trash.
Permanently delete a file
You can immediately delete a file permanently, without having to send it to the trash first.
To permanently delete a file:
Select the item you want to delete.
Press and hold the Shift key, then press the Delete key on your keyboard.
Because you cannot undo this, you will be asked to confirm that you want to delete the file or folder.
Deleted files on a removable device  may not be visible on other operating systems, such Windows or Mac OS. The files are still there, and will be available when you plug the device back into your computer.
Put files and documents onto a blank CD or DVD using a CD/DVD burner.
Write files to a CD or DVD
You can put files onto a blank disc by using CD/DVD Creator. The option to create a CD or DVD will appear in the file manager as soon as you place the CD into your CD/DVD writer. The file manager lets you transfer files to other computers or perform backups by putting files onto a blank disc. To write files to a CD or DVD:
Place an empty disc into your CD/DVD writable drive.
In the Blank CD/DVD-R Disc notification that pops up at the bottom of the screen, select Open with CD/DVD Creator. The CD/DVD Creator folder window will open.
(You can also click on Blank CD/DVD-R Disc under Devices in the file manager sidebar.)
In the Disc Name field, type a name for the disc.
Drag or copy the desired files into the window.
Click Write to Disc.
Under Select a disc to write to, choose the blank disc.
(You could choose Image file instead. This will put the files in a disc image, which will be saved on your computer. You can then burn that disc image onto a blank disc at a later date.)
Click Properties if you want to adjust burning speed, the location of temporary files, and other options. The default options should be fine.
Click the Burn button to begin recording.
If Burn Several Copies is selected, you will be prompted for additional discs.
When the disc burning is complete, it will eject automatically. Choose Make More Copies or Close to exit.
If the disc wasn’t burned properly
Sometimes the computer doesn’t record the data correctly, and you won’t be able to see the files you put onto the disc when you insert it into a computer.
In this case, try burning the disc again but use a lower burning speed, for example, 12x rather than 48x. Burning at slower speeds is more reliable. You can choose the speed by clicking the Properties button in the CD/DVD Creator window.
Make a file invisible, so you cannot see it in the file manager.
Hide a file
The Files file manager gives you the ability to hide and unhide files at your discretion. When a file is hidden, it is not displayed by the file manager, but it is still there in its folder.
To hide a file, rename it with a . at the beginning of its name. For example, to hide a file named example.txt, you should rename it to .example.txt.
You can hide folders in the same way that you can hide files. Hide a folder by placing a . at the beginning of the folder’s name.
Show all hidden files
If you want to see all hidden files in a folder, go to that folder and either click the view options button in the toolbar and pick Show Hidden Files, or press CtrlH. You will see all hidden files, along with regular files that are not hidden.
To hide these files again, either click the view options button in the toolbar and pick Show Hidden Files, or press CtrlH again.
Unhide a file
To unhide a file, go to the folder containing the hidden file and click the view options button in the toolbar and pick Show Hidden Files. Then, find the hidden file and rename it so that it does not have a . in front of its name. For example, to unhide a file called .example.txt, you should rename it to example.txt.
Once you have renamed the file, you can either click the view options button in the toolbar and pick Show Hidden Files, or press CtrlH to hide any other hidden files again.
By default, you will only see hidden files in the file manager until you close the file manager. To change this setting so that the file manager will always show hidden files, see .
Most hidden files will have a . at the beginning of their name, but others might have a  at the end of their name instead. These files are backup files. See  for more information.
Follow these tips if you can’t find a file you created or downloaded.
Find a lost file
If you created or downloaded a file, but now you cannot find it, follow these tips.
If you do not remember where you saved the file, but you have some idea of how you named it, you can search for the file by name.
If you just downloaded the file, your web browser might have automatically saved it to a common folder. Check the Desktop and Downloads folders in your home folder.
You might have accidentally deleted the file. When you delete a file, it gets moved to the trash, where it stays until you manually empty the trash. See  to learn how to recover a deleted file.
You might have renamed the file in a way that made the file hidden. Files that start with a . or end with a  are hidden in the file manager. Click the view options button in the Files toolbar and enable Show Hidden Files to display them. See  to learn more.
Open files using an application that isn’t the default one for that type of file. You can change the default too.
Open files with other applications
When you double-click (or middle-click) a file in the file manager, it will be opened with the default application for that file type. You can open it in a different application, search online for applications, or set the default application for all files of the same type.
To open a file with an application other than the default, right-click the file and select the application you want from the top of the menu. If you do not see the application you want, select Open With Other Application. By default, the file manager only shows applications that are known to handle the file. To look through all the applications on your computer, click View All Applications.
If you still cannot find the application you want, you can search for more applications by clicking Find New Applications. The file manager will search online for packages containing applications that are known to handle files of that type.
Change the default application
You can change the default application that is used to open files of a given type. This will allow you to open your preferred application when you double-click to open a file. For example, you might want your favorite music player to open when you double-click an MP3 file.
Select a file of the type whose default application you want to change. For example, to change which application is used to open MP3 files, select a .mp3 file.
Right-click the file and select Properties.
Select the Open With tab.
Select the application you want and click Set as default.
If Other Applications contains an application you sometimes want to use, but do not want to make the default, select that application and click Add. This will add it to Recommended Applications. You will then be able to use this application by right-clicking the file and selecting it from the list.
This changes the default application not just for the selected file, but for all files with the same type.
Quickly show and hide previews for documents, images, videos, and more.
Preview files and folders
You need to have Sushi installed on your computer to perform these steps.
Install Sushi
You can quickly preview files without opening them in a full-blown application. Select any file and press the space bar. The file will open in a simple preview window. Press the space bar again to dismiss the preview.
The built-in preview supports most file formats for documents, images, video, and audio. In the preview, you can scroll through your documents or seek through your video and audio.
To view a preview full-screen, press F or F11. Press F or F11 again to leave full-screen, or press the space bar to exit the preview completely.
Deleted files are normally sent to the Trash, but can be recovered.
Recover a file from the Trash
If you delete a file with the file manager, the file is normally placed into the Trash, and should be able to be restored.
To restore a file from the Trash:
Open the Activities overview and start typing Files.
Click on Files to open the file manager.
Click Trash in the sidebar. If you do not see the sidebar, press the menu button in the top-right corner of the window and select Sidebar.
If your deleted file is there, click on it and select Restore. It will be restored to the folder from where it was deleted.
If you deleted the file by pressing ShiftDelete , or by using the command line, the file has been permanently deleted. Files that have been permanently deleted can’t be recovered from the Trash.
There are a number of recovery tools available that are sometimes able to recover files that were permanently deleted. These tools are generally not very easy to use, however. If you accidentally permanently deleted a file, it’s probably best to ask for advice on a support forum to see if you can recover it.
Eject or unmount a USB flash drive, CD, DVD, or other device.
Safely remove an external drive
When you use external storage devices like USB flash drives, you should safely remove them before unplugging them. If you just unplug a device, you run the risk of unplugging while an application is still using it. This could result in some of your files being lost or damaged. When you use an optical disc like a CD or DVD, you can use the same steps to eject the disc from your computer.
To eject a removable device:
From the Activities overview, open Files.
Locate the device in the sidebar. It should have a small eject icon next to the name. Click the eject icon to safely remove or eject the device.
Alternately, you can right-click the name of the device in the sidebar and select Eject.
Safely remove a device that is in use
If any of the files on the device are open and in use by an application, you will not be able to safely remove the device. You will be prompted with a window telling you Volume is busy. To safely remove the device:
Click Cancel.
Close all the files on the device.
Click the eject icon to safely remove or eject the device.
You can also choose Eject Anyway to remove the device without closing the files. This may cause errors in applications that have those files open.
Change file or folder name.
Rename a file or folder
As with other file managers, you can use Files to change the name of a file or folder.
To rename a file or folder:
Right-click on the item and select Rename, or select the file and press F2.
Type the new name and press Enter or click Rename.
You can also rename a file from the properties window.
When you rename a file, only the first part of the name of the file is selected, not the file extension (the part after the last .). The extension normally denotes what type of file it is (for example, file.pdf is a PDF document), and you usually do not want to change that. If you need to change the extension as well, select the entire file name and change it.
If you renamed the wrong file, or named your file improperly, you can undo the rename. To revert the action, immediately click the menu button in the toolbar and select Undo Rename, or press CtrlZ, to restore the former name.
Valid characters for file names
You can use any character except the / (slash) character in file names. Some devices, however, use a file system that has more restrictions on file names. Therefore, it is a best practice to avoid the following characters in your file names: |, \, ?, *, lt;, ", :, gt;, /.
If you name a file with a . as the first character, the file will be hidden when you attempt to view it in the file manager.
Common problems
The file name is already in use
You cannot have two files or folders with the same name in the same folder. If you try to rename a file to a name that already exists in the folder you are working in, the file manager will not allow it.
File and folder names are case sensitive, so the file name File.txt is not the same as FILE.txt. Using different file names like this is allowed, though it is not recommended.
The file name is too long
On some file systems, file names can have no more than 255 characters in their names. This 255 character limit includes both the file name and the path to the file (for example, /home/wanda/Documents/work/business-proposals/…), so you should avoid long file and folder names where possible.
The option to rename is grayed out
If Rename is grayed out, you do not have permission to rename the file. You should use caution with renaming such files, as renaming some protected files may cause your system to become unstable. See  for more information.
Locate files based on file name and type.
Search for files
You can search for files based on their name or file type directly within the file manager.
Other search applications
Search
Open the Files application from the Activities overview.
If you know the files you want are under a particular folder, go to that folder.
Type a word or words that you know appear in the file name, and they will be shown in the search bar. For example, if you name all your invoices with the word “Invoice”, type invoice. Words are matched regardless of case.
Instead of typing words directly to bring up the search bar, you can click the  in the toolbar, or press CtrlF.
You can narrow your results by date, by file type, and by whether to search a file's full text, or to only search for file names.
To apply filters, select the drop-down menu button to the left of the file manager's  icon, and choose from the available filters:
When: How far back do you want to search?
What: What is the type of item?
Should your search include a full-text search, or search only the file names?
To remove a filter, select the X beside the filter tag that you want to remove.
You can open, copy, delete, or otherwise work with your files from the search results, just as you would from any folder in the file manager.
Click the  in the toolbar again to exit the search and return to the folder.
Customize files search
You may want certain directories to be included or excluded from searches in the Files application. To customize which directories are searched:
Open the Activities overview and start typing Search.
Select SettingsSearch from the results. This will open the Search Settings panel.
Select the  icon from the bottom of the Search settings panel.
This will open a separate settings panel which allows you toggle directory searches on or off. You can toggle searches on each of the three tabs:
Places: Lists common home directory locations
Bookmarks: Lists directory locations that you have bookmarked in the Files application
Other: Lists directory locations that you include via the + button.
Press CtrlS to select multiple files which have similar names.
Select files by pattern
You can select files in a folder using a pattern on the file name. Press CtrlS to bring up the Select Items Matching window. Type in a pattern using common parts of the file names plus wild card characters. There are two wild card characters available:
* matches any number of any characters, even no characters at all.
? matches exactly one of any character.
For example:
If you have an OpenDocument Text file, a PDF file, and an image that all have the same base name Invoice, select all three with the pattern
Invoice.*
If you have some photos that are named like Vacation-001.jpg, Vacation-002.jpg, Vacation-003.jpg; select them all with the pattern
Vacation-???.jpg
If you have photos as before, but you have edited some of them and added -edited to the end of the file name of the photos you have edited, select the edited photos with
Vacation-???-edited.jpg
Easily transfer files to your email contacts from the file manager.
Share files by email
You can easily share files with your contacts by email directly from the file manager.
Before you begin, make sure Evolution or Geary is installed on your computer, and your email account is configured.
To share a file by email:
Locate the file you want to transfer.
Right-click the file and select Send to…. An email compose window will appear with the file attached.
Click To to choose a contact, or enter an email address where you want to send the file. Fill in the Subject and the body of the message as required and click Send.
You can send multiple files at once. Select multiple files by holding down Ctrl while clicking the files, then right-click any selected file.
Arrange files by name, size, type, or when they were changed.
Sort files and folders
You can sort files in different ways in a folder, for example by sorting them in order of date or file size. See  below for a list of common ways to sort files. See  for information on how to change the default sort order.
The way that you can sort files depends on the folder view that you are using. You can change the current view using the list or icon buttons in the toolbar.
Icon view
To sort files in a different order, click the view options button in the toolbar and choose By Name, By Size, By Type, By Modification Date, or By Access Date.
As an example, if you select By Name, the files will be sorted by their names, in alphabetical order. See  for other options.
You can sort in the reverse order by selecting Reversed Order from the menu.
List view
To sort files in a different order, click one of the column headings in the file manager. For example, click Type to sort by file type. Click the column heading again to sort in the reverse order.
In list view, you can show columns with more attributes and sort on those columns. Click the view options button in the toolbar, pick Visible Columns… and select the columns that you want to be visible. You will then be able to sort by those columns. See  for descriptions of available columns.
Ways of sorting files
Name
Sorts alphabetically by the name of the file.
Size
Sorts by the size of the file (how much disk space it takes up). Sorts from smallest to largest by default.
Type
Sorts alphabetically by the file type. Files of the same type are grouped together, then sorted by name.
Last Modified
Sorts by the date and time that a file was last changed. Sorts from oldest to newest by default.

If you often create documents based on the same content, you might benefit from using file templates. A file template can be a document of any type with the formatting or content you would like to reuse. For example, you could create a template document with your letterhead.
Make a new template
Create a document that you are going to use as a template. For example, you could make your letterhead in a word processing application.
Save the file with the template content in the Templates folder in your Home folder. If the Templates folder does not exist, you will need to create it first.
Use a template to create a document
Open the folder where you want to place the new document.
Right-click anywhere in the empty space in the folder, then choose New Document. The names of available templates will be listed in the submenu.
Choose your desired template from the list.
Double-click the file to open it and start editing. You may wish to rename the file when you are finished.
These are backup files. They are hidden by default.
What is a file with a  at the end of its name?
Files with a  at the end of their names (for example, example.txt) are automatically created backup copies of documents edited in the gedit text editor or other applications. It is safe to delete them, but there is no harm to leave them on your computer.
These files are hidden by default. If you are seeing them, that is because you either selected Show Hidden Files (in the view options menu of the Files toolbar) or pressed CtrlH. You can hide them again by repeating either of these steps.
These files are treated in the same way as normal hidden files. See  for advice on dealing with hidden files.

Consider switching to GNOME Classic if you prefer a more traditional desktop experience.
What is GNOME Classic?
GNOME Classic is a feature for users who prefer a more traditional desktop experience. While GNOME Classic is based on GNOME 3 technologies, it provides a number of changes to the user interface, such as the Applications and Places menus on the top bar, and a window list at the bottom of the screen.

While GNOME Classic is based on GNOME 3 technologies, it provides a number of changes to the user interface, such as the Applications and Places menus on the top bar, and a window list at the bottom of the screen.
You can use the Applications menu on the top bar to launch applications. The Activities overview is available by selecting the Activities Overview item from the menu.
To access the Activities overview, you can also press the Super key.
Window list
The window list at the bottom of the screen provides access to all your open windows and applications and lets you quickly minimize and restore them.
At the right-hand side of the window list, GNOME displays a short identifier for the current workspace, such as 1 for the first (top) workspace. In addition, the identifier also displays the total number of available workspaces. To switch to a different workspace, you can click the identifier and select the workspace you want to use from the menu.
Switch to and from GNOME Classic
GNOME Classic is only available on systems with certain GNOME Shell extensions installed. Some Linux distributions may not have these extensions available or installed by default.
To switch from GNOME to GNOME Classic:
Save any open work, and then log out. Click the system menu on the right side of the top bar, click your name and then choose the right option.
A confirmation message will appear. Select Log Out to confirm.
At the login screen, select your name from the list.
Enter your password in the password entry box.
Click the options icon, which is displayed to the left of the Sign In button, and select GNOME Classic.
Click the Sign In button.
To switch from GNOME Classic to GNOME:

Fingerprint readers, smart cards…
Fingerprints amp; smart cards
Troubleshoot media card readers.
Media card reader problems
Many computers contain readers for SD, MMC, SM, MS, CF, and other storage media cards. These should be automatically detected and mounted. Here are some troubleshooting steps if they are not:
Make sure that the card is put in correctly. Many cards look as though they are upside down when correctly inserted. Also make sure that the card is firmly seated in the slot; some cards, especially CF, require a small amount of force to insert correctly. (Be careful not to push too hard! If you come up against something solid, do not force it.)
Open Files from the Activities overview. Does the inserted card appear in the Devices list in the left sidebar? Sometimes the card appears in this list but is not mounted; click it once to mount. (If the sidebar is not visible, press F9 or click Files in the top bar and select the Sidebar.)
If your card does not show up in the sidebar, press CtrlL, then type computer:/// and press Enter. If your card reader is correctly configured, the reader should come up as a drive when no card is present, and the card itself when the card has been mounted.
If you see the card reader but not the card, the problem may be with the card itself. Try a different card or check the card on a different reader if possible.
If no cards or drives are shown when browsing the Computer location, it is possible that your card reader does not work with Linux due to driver issues. If your card reader is internal (inside the computer instead of sitting outside) this is more likely. The best solution is to directly connect your device (camera, cell phone, etc.) to a USB port on the computer. USB external card readers are also available, and are far better supported by Linux.
A hardware/device driver allows your computer to use devices that are attached to it.
What is a driver?
Devices are the physical “parts” of your computer. They may be external like printers and monitor or internal like graphics and audio cards.
In order for your computer to be able to use these devices, it needs to know how to communicate with them. This is done by a piece of software called a device driver.
When you attach a device to your computer, you must have the correct driver installed for that device to work. For example, if you plug in a printer but the correct driver is not available, you will not be able to use the printer. Normally, each model of device uses a driver that is not compatible with any other model.
On Linux, the drivers for most devices are installed by default, so everything should work when you plug it in. However, the drivers may need to be installed manually or may not be available at all.
In addition, some existing drivers are incomplete or partially non-functional. For example, you might find that your printer cannot do double-sided printing, but is otherwise completely functional.

Get live support on IRC.
IRC
IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat. It is a real-time multi-user messaging system. You can get help and advice on the GNOME IRC server from other GNOME users and developers.
To connect to the GNOME IRC server, use empathy or xchat, or use a web interface like mibbit.
To create an IRC account in empathy, see the Empathy documentation.
The GNOME IRC server is irc.gnome.org. You may also see it referred to as the "GIMP network". If your computer is properly configured you can click on the link  to access the gnome channel.
While IRC is a real-time discussion medium, people tend to not reply immediately, so be patient.
Please note the GNOME code of conduct applies when you chat on IRC.
Request support by e-mail.
Mailing list
Mailing lists are email based discussions. You can ask for support using the GNOME mailing lists. Almost each GNOME application has its own mailing list. The complete list of mailing-lists are listed at .
You may need to subscribe to the mailing-list before being able to send an email to it.
The default language used on mailing lists is English. There are user mailing lists for other languages. For example, gnome-de for German speakers or gnome-cl-list for all things related to Chile.

The Menu key launches a context menu with the keyboard rather than with a right-click.
What is the Menu key?
The Menu key, also known as the Application key, is a key found on some Windows-oriented keyboards. This key is usually on the bottom-right of the keyboard, next to the Ctrl key, but it can be placed in a different location by keyboard manufacturers. Its is usually depicted as a cursor hovering above a menu: .
The primary function of this key is to launch a context menu with the keyboard rather than by clicking the right mouse button: this is useful if mouse or a similar device is not available, or when the right mouse button is not present.
The Menu key is sometimes omitted in the interest of space, particularly on portable and laptop keyboards. In this case, some keyboards include a Menu function key that can be activated in combination with the Function (Fn) key.
The context menu is a menu that pops up when you right-click. The menu that you see, if any, is dependent on the context and function of the area that you right-clicked. When you use the Menu key, the context menu is shown for the area of the screen that your cursor is over at the point when the key is pressed.
The Super key opens the Activities overview. You can usually find it next to the Alt key on your keyboard.
What is the Super key?
When you press the Super key, the Activities overview is displayed. This key can usually be found on the bottom-left of your keyboard, next to the Alt key, and usually has a Windows logo on it. It is sometimes called the Windows key or system key.
If you have an Apple keyboard, you will have a ⌘ (Command) key instead of the Windows key, while Chromebooks have a magnifying glass instead.
To change which key is used to display the Activities overview:
Click Keyboard in the sidebar to open the panel.
In the System category, click the row with Show the activities overview.
Hold down the desired key combination.

Add keyboard layouts and switch between them.
Use alternative keyboard layouts
Keyboards come in hundreds of different layouts for different languages. Even for a single language, there are often multiple keyboard layouts, such as the Dvorak layout for English. You can make your keyboard behave like a keyboard with a different layout, regardless of the letters and symbols printed on the keys. This is useful if you often switch between multiple languages.
Click Region amp; Language in the sidebar to open the panel.
Click the + button in the Input Sources section, select the language which is associated with the layout, then select a layout and press Add.
If there are multiple user accounts on your system, there is a separate instance of the Region amp; Language panel for the login screen. Click the Login Screen button at the top right to toggle between the two instances.
Some rarely used keyboard layout variants are not available by default when you click the + button. To make also those input sources available you can open a terminal window by pressing CtrlAltT and run this command:
preview
You can preview an image of any layout by selecting it in the list of Input Sources and clicking 
preferences
Certain languages offer some extra configuration options. You can identify those languages because they have a  icon next to them. If you want to access these extra parameters, select the language from the Input Source list and a new  button will give you access to the extra settings.
When you use multiple layouts, you can choose to have all windows use the same layout or to set a different layout for each window. Using a different layout for each window is useful, for example, if you’re writing an article in another language in a word processor window. Your keyboard selection will be remembered for each window as you switch between windows. Press the Options button to select how you want to manage multiple layouts.
The top bar will display a short identifier for the current layout, such as en for the standard English layout. Click the layout indicator and select the layout you want to use from the menu. If the selected language has any extra settings, they will be shown below the list of available layouts. This gives you a quick overview of your settings. You can also open an image with the current keyboard layout for reference.
The fastest way to change to another layout is by using the Input Source Keyboard Shortcuts. These shortcuts open the Input Source chooser where you can move forward and backward. By default, you can switch to the next input source with SuperSpace and to the previous one with ShiftSuperSpace. You can change these shortcuts in the Keyboard settings.

The screen resolution may be set incorrectly.
Why do things look fuzzy/pixelated on my screen?
The display resolution that is configured may not be the correct one for your screen. To solve this:
Try some of the Resolution options and select the one that makes the screen look better.
When multiple displays are connected
If you have two displays connected to the computer (for example, a normal monitor and a projector), the displays might have different optimal, or native, resolutions.
Using Mirror mode, you can display the same thing on two screens. Both screens use the same resolution, which may not match the native resolution of either screen, so the sharpness of the image may suffer on both screens.
Using Join Displays mode, the resolution of each screen can be set independently, so they can both be set to their native resolution.
Change the resolution of the screen and its orientation (rotation).
Change the resolution or orientation of the screen
You can change how big (or how detailed) things appear on the screen by changing the screen resolution. You can change which way up things appear (for example, if you have a rotating display) by changing the rotation.
Open the Activities overview and start typing Displays.
Click Displays to open the panel.
If you have multiple displays and they are not mirrored, you can have different settings on each display. Select a display in the preview area.
Resolution
The resolution is the number of pixels (dots on the screen) in each direction that can be displayed. Each resolution has an aspect ratio, the ratio of the width to the height. Wide-screen displays use a 16∶9 aspect ratio, while traditional displays use 4∶3. If you choose a resolution that does not match the aspect ratio of your display, the screen will be letterboxed to avoid distortion, by adding black bars to the top and bottom or both sides of the screen.
You can choose the resolution you prefer from the Resolution drop-down list. If you choose one that is not right for your screen it may look fuzzy or pixelated.
Native Resolution
The native resolution of a laptop screen or LCD monitor is the one that works best: the pixels in the video signal will line up precisely with the pixels on the screen. When the screen is required to show other resolutions, interpolation is necessary to represent the pixels, causing a loss of image quality.
Scale
The scale setting increases the size of objects shown on the screen to match the density of your display, making them easier to read. Choose from 100%, 200%, or 300%.
Orientation
On some devices, you can physically rotate the screen in many directions. Click Orientation in the panel and choose from Landscape, Portrait Right, Portrait Left, or Landscape (flipped).

If your device rotates the screen automatically, you can lock the current rotation using the  button at the bottom of the system menu. To unlock, press the  button

Control how quickly you need to press the mouse button a second time to double-click.
Adjust the double-click speed
Double-clicking only happens when you press the mouse button twice quickly enough. If the second press is too long after the first, you’ll just get two separate clicks, not a double click. If you have difficulty pressing the mouse button quickly, you should increase the timeout.
Under Pointing amp; Clicking, adjust the Double-Click Delay slider to a value you find comfortable.
If your mouse double-clicks when you want it to single-click even though you have increased the double-click timeout, your mouse may be faulty. Try plugging a different mouse into your computer and see if that works properly. Alternatively, plug your mouse into a different computer and see if it still has the same problem.
This setting will affect both your mouse and touchpad, as well as any other pointing device.
Reverse the left and right mouse buttons in the mouse settings.
Use your mouse left-handed
You can swap the behavior of the left and right buttons on your mouse or touchpad to make it more comfortable for left-handed use.
Open the Activities overview and start typing Mouse amp; Touchpad.
Click on Mouse amp; Touchpad to open the panel.
In the General section, click to switch Primary button to Right.
Use the middle mouse button to open applications, open tabs and more.
Middle-click
Many mice and some touchpads have a middle mouse button. On a mouse with a scroll wheel, you can usually press directly down on the scroll wheel to middle-click. If you don’t have a middle mouse button, you can press the left and right mouse buttons at the same time to middle-click.
On touchpads that support multi-finger taps, you can tap with three fingers at once to middle-click. You have to enable tap clicking in the touchpad settings for this to work.
Many applications use middle-click for advanced click shortcuts.
In applications with scrollbars, left-clicking in the empty space of the bar moves the scroll position directly to that place. Middle-clicking moves up to a single page towards that location.
In the Activities overview, you can quickly open a new window for an application with middle-click. Simply middle-click on the application’s icon, either in the dash on the left, or in the applications overview. The applications overview is displayed using the grid button in the dash.
Most web browsers allow you to open links in tabs quickly with the middle mouse button. Just click any link with your middle mouse button, and it will open in a new tab.
In the file manager, middle-click serves two roles. If you middle-click a folder, it will open in a new tab. This mimics the behavior of popular web browsers. If you middle-click a file, it will open the file, just as if you had double-clicked.
Some specialized applications allow you to use the middle mouse button for other functions. Search your application’s help for middle-click or middle mouse button.

Enable mouse keys to control the mouse with the numeric keypad.
Click and move the mouse pointer using the keypad
If you have difficulties using a mouse or other pointing device, you can control the mouse pointer using the numeric keypad on your keyboard. This feature is called mouse keys.
You can access the Activities overview by pressing on it, by moving your mouse pointer against the top-left corner of the screen, by using CtrlAltTab followed by Enter, or by using the Super key.
Use the up and down arrow keys to select Mouse Keys in the Pointing amp; Clicking section, then press Enter to switch the Mouse Keys switch to on.
Make sure that Num Lock is turned off. You will now be able to move the mouse pointer using the keypad.
The keypad is a set of numerical buttons on your keyboard, usually arranged into a square grid. If you have a keyboard without a keypad (such as a laptop keyboard), you may need to hold down the function (Fn) key and use certain other keys on your keyboard as a keypad. If you use this feature often on a laptop, you can purchase external USB or Bluetooth numeric keypads.
Each number on the keypad corresponds to a direction. For example, pressing 8 will move the pointer upwards and pressing 2 will move it downwards. Press the 5 key to click once with the mouse, or quickly press it twice to double-click.
Most keyboards have a special key which allows you to right-click, sometimes called the Menu key. Note, however, that this key responds to where your keyboard focus is, not where your mouse pointer is. See  for information on how to right-click by holding down 5 or the left mouse button.
If you want to use the keypad to type numbers while mouse keys is enabled, turn Num Lock on. The mouse cannot be controlled with the keypad when Num Lock is turned on, though.
The normal number keys, in a line at the top of the keyboard, will not control the mouse pointer. Only the keypad number keys can be used.

If you have a mouse with a cable, check that it is firmly plugged in to your computer.
If it is a USB mouse (with a rectangular connector), try plugging it in to a different USB port. If it is a PS/2 mouse (with a small, round connector with six pins), make sure that it is plugged in to the green mouse port rather than the purple keyboard port. You may need to restart the computer if it was not plugged in.
Check that the mouse actually works
Plug the mouse in to a different computer and see if it works.
If the mouse is an optical or laser mouse, a light should be shining out of the bottom of the mouse if it is turned on. If there is no light, check that it is turned on. If it is and there is still no light, the mouse may be broken.
Checking wireless mice
Make sure the mouse is turned on. There is often a switch on the bottom of the mouse to turn the mouse off completely, so you can take it with you without it constantly waking up.
If you are using a Bluetooth mouse, make sure you have actually paired the mouse with your computer. See .
Click a button and see if the mouse pointer moves now. Some wireless mice go to sleep to save power, so might not respond until you click a button. See .
Check that the battery of the mouse is charged.
Make sure that the receiver (dongle) is firmly plugged in to the computer.
If your mouse and receiver can operate on different radio channels, make sure that they are both set to the same channel.
You may need to press a button on the mouse, receiver or both to establish a connection. The instruction manual of your mouse should have more details if this is the case.
Most RF (radio) wireless mice should work automatically when you plug them into your computer. If you have a Bluetooth or IR (infrared) wireless mouse, you may need to perform some extra steps to get it working. The steps might depend on the make or model of your mouse.
Change how quickly the pointer moves when you use your mouse or touchpad.
Adjust the speed of the mouse and touchpad
If your pointer moves too fast or slow when you move your mouse or use your touchpad, you can adjust the pointer speed for these devices.
Adjust the Mouse Speed or Touchpad Speed slider until the pointer motion is comfortable for you. Sometimes the most comfortable settings for one type of device are not the best for the other.
The Touchpad section only appears if your system has a touchpad, while the Mouse section is only visible when a mouse is connected.
Click, drag, or scroll using taps and gestures on your touchpad.
Click, drag, or scroll with the touchpad
You can click, double-click, drag, and scroll using only your touchpad, without separate hardware buttons.
Touchscreen gestures are covered separately.
Tap to click
You can tap your touchpad to click instead of using a button.
In the Touchpad section, make sure the Touchpad switch is set to on.
The Touchpad section only appears if your system has a touchpad.
Switch the Tap to click switch to on.
To click, tap on the touchpad.
To double-click, tap twice.
To drag an item, double-tap but don’t lift your finger after the second tap. Drag the item where you want it, then lift your finger to drop.
If your touchpad supports multi-finger taps, right-click by tapping with two fingers at once. Otherwise, you still need to use hardware buttons to right-click. See  for a method of right-clicking without a second mouse button.
If your touchpad supports multi-finger taps, middle-click by tapping with three fingers at once.
When tapping or dragging with multiple fingers, make sure your fingers are spread far enough apart. If your fingers are too close, your computer may think they’re a single finger.
Two finger scroll
You can scroll using your touchpad using two fingers.
Switch the Two-finger Scrolling switch to on.
When this is selected, tapping and dragging with one finger will work as normal, but if you drag two fingers across any part of the touchpad, it will scroll instead. Move your fingers between the top and bottom of your touchpad to scroll up and down, or move your fingers across the touchpad to scroll sideways. Be careful to space your fingers a bit apart. If your fingers are too close together, they just look like one big finger to your touchpad.
Two-finger scrolling may not work on all touchpads.
Natural scrolling
You can drag content as if sliding a physical piece of paper using the touchpad.
In the Touchpad section, make sure that the Touchpad switch is set to on.
Switch the Natural Scrolling switch to on.
This feature is also known as Reverse Scrolling.

If you have to wiggle or click the mouse before it responds.
Mouse reacts with delay before it starts working
Wireless and optical mice, as well as touchpads on laptops, may need to “wake up” before they start working. They automatically go to sleep when not in use to save battery power. To wake up your mouse or touchpad, you can click on a mouse button or wiggle the mouse.

Support for that file format might not be installed or the songs could be “copy protected”.
I can’t play the songs I bought from an online music store
If you downloaded some music from an online store you may find that it won’t play on your computer, especially if you bought it on a Windows or Mac OS computer and then copied it over.
This could be because the music is in a format that is not recognized by your computer. To be able to play a song you need to have support for the right audio formats installed — for example, if you want to play MP3 files, you need MP3 support installed. If you don’t have support for a given audio format, you should see a message telling you so when you try to play a song. The message should also provide instructions for how to install support for that format so that you can play it.
If you do have support installed for the song’s audio format but still can’t play it, the song might be copy protected (also known as being DRM restricted). DRM is a way of restricting who can play a song and on what devices they can play it. The company that sold the song to you is in control of this, not you. If a music file has DRM restrictions, you will probably not be able to play it — you generally need special software from the vendor to play DRM restricted files, but this software is often not supported on Linux.
You can learn more about DRM from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
Use a media player to copy the songs and safely remove the iPod afterward.
Songs don’t appear on my iPod when I copy them onto it
When you plug an iPod into your computer, it will appear in your music player application and also in the file manager (the Files application in the Activities overview). You must copy songs onto the iPod using the music player — if you copy them across using the file manager, it won’t work because the songs won’t be put into the right location. iPods have a special location for storing songs which music player applications know how to get to but the file manager does not.
You also need to wait for the songs to finish copying to the iPod before you unplug it. Before unplugging the iPod, make sure you choose to safely remove it. This will make sure that all of the songs have been copied across properly.
A further reason why songs might not be appearing on your iPod is that the music player application you’re using does not support converting the songs from one audio format to another. If you copy a song which is saved in an audio format that is not supported by your iPod (for example, an Ogg Vorbis (.oga) file), the music player will try to convert it to a format that the iPod does understand, such as MP3. If the appropriate conversion software (also called a codec or encoder) is not installed, the music player will not be able to do the conversion and so will not copy the song. Look in the software installer for an appropriate codec.
Brand-new iPods need to be set-up using the iTunes software before you can use them.
My new iPod won’t work
If you have a new iPod that has never been connected to a computer before, it won’t be recognized properly when you connect it to a Linux computer. This is because iPods need to be set up and updated using the iTunes software, which only runs on Windows and Mac OS.
To set up your iPod, install iTunes on a Windows or Mac computer and plug it in. You will be led through a few steps to set it up. If asked for the Volume Format, choose MS-DOS (FAT), Windows or similar. The other format (HFS/Mac) does not work as well with Linux.
Once you have finished setup, the iPod should work normally when you plug it into a Linux computer.
Single-click to open files, run or view executable text files, and specify trash behavior.
Sindhu S
File manager behavior preferences
You can control whether you single-click or double-click files, how executable text files are handled, and the trash behavior. Click the menu button in the top-right corner of the window and select Preferences, and select the Behavior tab.
Behavior
Single click to open items
Double click to open items
By default, clicking selects files and double-clicking opens them. You can instead choose to have files and folders open when you click on them once. When you use single-click mode, you can hold down the Ctrl key while clicking to select one or more files.
Executable text files
An executable text file is a file that contains a program that you can run (execute). The file permissions must also allow for the file to run as a program. The most common are Shell, Python and Perl scripts. These have extensions .sh, .py and .pl, respectively.
When you open an executable text file, you can select from:
Run executable text files when they are opened
View executable text files when they are opened
Ask each time
If Ask each time is selected, a dialog will pop up asking if you wish to run or view the selected text file.
Executable text files are also called scripts. All scripts in the /.local/share/nautilus/scripts folder will appear in the context menu for a file under the Scripts submenu. When a script is executed from a local folder, all selected files will be pasted to the script as parameters. To execute a script on a file:
Navigate to the desired folder.
Select the desired file.
Right click on the file to open the context menu and select the desired script to execute from the Scripts menu.
A script will not be passed any parameters when executed from a remote folder such as a folder showing web or ftp content.
File manager trash preferences
Trash
Ask before emptying the Trash
This option is selected by default. When emptying the trash, a message will be displayed confirming that you would like to empty the trash or delete files.
Add, delete, and rename bookmarks in the file manager.
Edit folder bookmarks
Your bookmarks are listed in the sidebar of the file manager.
Add a bookmark:
Open the folder (or location) that you want to bookmark.
Click the window menu in the toolbar and pick Bookmark this Location.
Delete a bookmark:
Right-click on the bookmark in the sidebar and select Remove from the menu.
Rename a bookmark:
Right-click on the bookmark in the sidebar and select Rename….
In the Name text box, type the new name for the bookmark.
Renaming a bookmark does not rename the folder. If you have bookmarks to two different folders in two different locations, but which each have the same name, the bookmarks will have the same name, and you won’t be able to tell them apart. In these cases, it is useful to give a bookmark a name other than the name of the folder it points to.
View and edit files on another computer over FTP, SSH, Windows shares, or WebDAV.
Browse files on a server or network share
You can connect to a server or network share to browse and view files on that server, exactly as if they were on your own computer. This is a convenient way to download or upload files on the internet, or to share files with other people on your local network.
To browse files over the network, open the Files application from the Activities overview, and click Other Locations in the sidebar. The file manager will find any computers on your local area network that advertise their ability to serve files. If you want to connect to a server on the internet, or if you do not see the computer you’re looking for, you can manually connect to a server by typing in its internet/network address.
Connect to a file server
In the file manager, click Other Locations in the sidebar.
In Connect to Server, enter the address of the server, in the form of a URL. Details on supported URLs are listed below.
If you have connected to the server before, you can click on it in the Recent Servers list.
Click Connect. The files on the server will be shown. You can browse the files just as you would for those on your own computer. The server will also be added to the sidebar so you can access it quickly in the future.
Writing URLs
A URL, or uniform resource locator, is a form of address that refers to a location or file on a network. The address is formatted like this:
scheme://servername.example.com/folder
The scheme specifies the protocol or type of server. The example.com portion of the address is called the domain name. If a username is required, it is inserted before the server name:
scheme://username@servername.example.com/folder
Some schemes require the port number to be specified. Insert it after the domain name:
scheme://servername.example.com:port/folder
Below are specific examples for the various server types that are supported.
Types of servers
You can connect to different types of servers. Some servers are public, and allow anybody to connect. Other servers require you to log in with a username and password.
You may not have permissions to perform certain actions on files on a server. For example, on public FTP sites, you will probably not be able to delete files.
The URL you enter depends on the protocol that the server uses to export its file shares.
SSH
If you have a secure shell account on a server, you can connect using this method. Many web hosts provide SSH accounts to members so they can securely upload files. SSH servers always require you to log in.
A typical SSH URL looks like this:
ssh://username@servername.example.com/folder
When using SSH, all the data you send (including your password) is encrypted so that other users on your network can’t see it.
FTP (with login)
FTP is a popular way to exchange files on the Internet. Because data is not encrypted over FTP, many servers now provide access through SSH. Some servers, however, still allow or require you to use FTP to upload or download files. FTP sites with logins will usually allow you to delete and upload files.
A typical FTP URL looks like this:
ftp://username@ftp.example.com/path/
Public FTP
Sites that allow you to download files will sometimes provide public or anonymous FTP access. These servers do not require a username and password, and will usually not allow you to delete or upload files.
A typical anonymous FTP URL looks like this:
ftp://ftp.example.com/path/
Some anonymous FTP sites require you to log in with a public username and password, or with a public username using your email address as the password. For these servers, use the FTP (with login) method, and use the credentials specified by the FTP site.
Windows share
Windows computers use a proprietary protocol to share files over a local area network. Computers on a Windows network are sometimes grouped into domains for organization and to better control access. If you have the right permissions on the remote computer, you can connect to a Windows share from the file manager.
A typical Windows share URL looks like this:
smb://servername/Share
WebDAV and Secure WebDAV
Based on the HTTP protocol used on the web, WebDAV is sometimes used to share files on a local network and to store files on the internet. If the server you’re connecting to supports secure connections, you should choose this option. Secure WebDAV uses strong SSL encryption, so that other users can’t see your password.
A WebDAV URL looks like this:
dav://example.hostname.com/path
NFS share
UNIX computers traditionally use the Network File System protocol to share files over a local network. With NFS, security is based on the UID of the user accessing the share, so no authentication credentials are needed when connecting.
A typical NFS share URL looks like this:
nfs://servername/path
Control icon captions used in the file manager.
File manager display preferences
You can control how the file manager displays captions under icons. Click the menu button in the top-right corner of the window and select Preferences, then select the Views tab.
Icon captions
external ref='figures/nautilus-icons.png' md5='c23665786e41e7bcb87fa0f8d355d74e'
File manager icons with captions
When you use icon view, you can choose to have extra information about files and folders displayed in a caption under each icon. This is useful, for example, if you often need to see who owns a file or when it was last modified.
You can zoom in a folder by clicking the view options button in the toolbar and choosing a zoom level with the slider. As you zoom in, the file manager will display more and more information in captions. You can choose up to three things to show in captions. The first will be displayed at most zoom levels. The last will only be shown at very large sizes.
The information you can show in icon captions is the same as the columns you can use in list view. See  for more information.
List View
When viewing files as a list, you can Navigate folders in a tree. This shows expanders on each directory in the file list, so that the contents of several folders can be shown at once. This is useful if the folder structure is relevant, such as if your music files are organized with a folder per artist, and a subfolder per album.
View basic file information, set permissions, and choose default applications.
File properties
To view information about a file or folder, right-click it and select Properties. You can also select the file and press AltEnter.
The file properties window shows you information like the type of file, the size of the file, and when you last modified it. If you need this information often, you can have it displayed in list view columns or icon captions.
The information given on the Basic tab is explained below. There are also Permissions and Open With tabs. For certain types of files, such as images and videos, there will be an extra tab that provides information like the dimensions, duration, and codec.
Basic properties
Name
You can rename the file by changing this field. You can also rename a file outside the properties window. See .
Type
This helps you identify the type of the file, such as PDF document, OpenDocument Text, or JPEG image. The file type determines which applications can open the file, among other things. For example, you can’t open a picture with a music player. See  for more information on this.
The MIME type of the file is shown in parentheses; MIME type is a standard way that computers use to refer to the file type.
Contents
This field is displayed if you are looking at the properties of a folder rather than a file. It helps you see the number of items in the folder. If the folder includes other folders, each inner folder is counted as one item, even if it contains further items. Each file is also counted as one item. If the folder is empty, the contents will display nothing.
This field is displayed if you are looking at a file (not a folder). The size of a file tells you how much disk space it takes up. This is also an indicator of how long it will take to download a file or send it in an email (big files take longer to send/receive).
Sizes may be given in bytes, KB, MB, or GB; in the case of the last three, the size in bytes will also be given in parentheses. Technically, 1 KB is 1024 bytes, 1 MB is 1024 KB and so on.
Parent Folder
The location of each file on your computer is given by its absolute path. This is a unique “address” of the file on your computer, made up of a list of the folders that you would need to go into to find the file. For example, if Jim had a file called Resume.pdf in his Home folder, its parent folder would be /home/jim and its location would be /home/jim/Resume.pdf.
Free Space
This is only displayed for folders. It gives the amount of disk space which is available on the disk that the folder is on. This is useful for checking if the hard disk is full.
Accessed
The date and time when the file was last opened.
Modified
The date and time when the file was last changed and saved.
Control who can view and edit your files and folders.
Set file permissions
You can use file permissions to control who can view and edit files that you own. To view and set the permissions for a file, right click it and select Properties, then select the Permissions tab.
See  and  below for details on the types of permissions you can set.
You can set the permissions for the file owner, the group owner, and all other users of the system. For your files, you are the owner, and you can give yourself read-only or read-and-write permission. Set a file to read-only if you don’t want to accidentally change it.
Every user on your computer belongs to a group. On home computers, it is common for each user to have their own group, and group permissions are not often used. In corporate environments, groups are sometimes used for departments or projects. As well as having an owner, each file belongs to a group. You can set the file’s group and control the permissions for all users in that group. You can only set the file’s group to a group you belong to.
You can also set the permissions for users other than the owner and those in the file’s group.
If the file is a program, such as a script, you must select Allow executing file as program to run it. Even with this option selected, the file manager may still open the file in an application or ask you what to do. See  for more information.
Folders
You can set permissions on folders for the owner, group, and other users. See the details of file permissions above for an explanation of owners, groups, and other users.
The permissions you can set for a folder are different from those you can set for a file.
None
The user will not even be able to see what files are in the folder.
List files only
The user will be able to see what files are in the folder, but will not be able to open, create, or delete files.
Access files
The user will be able to open files in the folder (provided they have permission to do so on the particular file), but will not be able to create new files or delete files.
Create and delete files
The user will have full access to the folder, including opening, creating, and deleting files.
You can also quickly set the file permissions for all the files in the folder by clicking Change Permissions for Enclosed Files. Use the drop-down lists to adjust the permissions of contained files or folders, and click Change. Permissions are applied to files and folders in subfolders as well, to any depth.
Control what information is displayed in columns in list view.
Files list columns preferences
There are eleven columns of information that you can display in the Files list view. Click the menu button in the top-right corner of the window, select Preferences and choose the List Columns tab to select which columns will be visible.
Use the Move Up and Move Down buttons to choose the order in which the selected columns will appear. Click Reset to Default to undo any changes and return to the default columns.
The name of folders and files.
The Name column cannot be hidden.
The size of a folder is given as the number of items contained in the folder. The size of a file is given as bytes, KB, or MB.
Displayed as folder, or file type such as PDF document, JPEG image, MP3 audio, and more.
Gives the date of the last time the file was modified.
Owner
The name of the user the folder or file is owned by.
Group
The group the file is owned by. Each user is normally in their own group, but it is possible to have many users in one group. For example, a department may have their own group in a work environment.
Permissions
Displays the file access permissions. For example, drwxrw-r--
The first character is the file type. - means regular file and d means directory (folder). In rare cases, other characters can also be shown.
The next three characters rwx specify permissions for the user who owns the file.
The next three rw- specify permissions for all members of the group that owns the file.
The last three characters in the column r-- specify permissions for all other users on the system.
Each permission has the following meanings:
r: readable, meaning that you can open the file or folder
w: writable, meaning that you can save changes to it
x: executable, meaning that you can run it if it is a program or script file, or you can access subfolders and files if it is a folder
-: permission not set
MIME Type
Displays the MIME type of the item.
Location
The path to the location of the file.
Modified — Time
Gives the date and time of the last time the file was modified.
Gives the date or time of the last time the file was modified.
View and set preferences for the file browser.
File manager preferences
Control when thumbnails are used for files.
File manager preview preferences
The file manager creates thumbnails to preview image, video, and text files. Thumbnail previews can be slow for large files or over networks, so you can control when previews are made. Click the menu button in the top-right of the window, select Preferences, then select the Search amp; Preview tab.
Files
By default, all previews are done for Files on this computer only, those on your computer or connected external drives. You can set this feature to All Files or Never. The file manager can browse files on other computers over a local area network or the internet. If you often browse files over a local area network, and the network has high bandwidth, you may want to set the preview option to All Files.
In addition, you can use the Only for files smaller than setting to limit the size of files previewed.
File count
If you show file sizes in list view columns or icon captions, folders will be shown with a count of how many files and folders they contain. Counting items in a folder can be slow, especially for very large folders, or over a network.
You can turn this feature on or off, or turn it on only for files on your computer and local external drives.
Specify the default sort order and grouping for the file manager.
Views preferences in Files
You can change how files and folders are grouped and sorted by default. Press the menu button in the top-right corner of the window, select Preferences, and then select the Views tab.
Default view
Arrange items
You can change how files are sorted in an individual folder by clicking the view options menu button in the toolbar and choosing the desired option under Sort, or by clicking the list column headers in list view.
Sort folders before files
By default, the file manager no longer shows all folders before files. To see all folders listed before files, enable this option.
There are few Linux viruses, so you probably don’t need anti-virus software.
Do I need anti-virus software?
If you are used to Windows or Mac OS, you are probably also used to having anti-virus software running all of the time. Anti-virus software runs in the background, constantly checking for computer viruses that might find their way onto your computer and cause problems.
Anti-virus software does exist for Linux, but you probably don’t need to use it. Viruses that affect Linux are still very rare. Some argue that this is because Linux is not as widely used as other operating systems, so no one writes viruses for it. Others argue that Linux is intrinsically more secure, and security problems that viruses could make use of are fixed very quickly.
Whatever the reason, Linux viruses are so rare that you don’t really need to worry about them at the moment.
If you want to be extra-safe, or if you want to check for viruses in files that you are passing between yourself and people using Windows and Mac OS, you can still install anti-virus software. Check in the software installer or search online; a number of applications are available.

Web browsers
Change the default web browser by going to Details in Settings.
Change which web browser opens websites by default
When you click a link to a web page in any application, a web browser will automatically open up to that page. However, if you have more than one browser installed, the page may not open up in the browser you wanted it to open in. To fix this, change the default web browser:
Choose Default Applications from the list on the left side of the window.
Choose which web browser you would like to open links by changing the Web option.
When you open up a different web browser, it might tell you that it’s not the default browser any more. If this happens, click the Cancel button (or similar) so that it does not try to set itself as the default browser again.
Change the default email client by going to Details in Settings.
Change which mail application is used to write emails
When you click a button or link to send a new email (for example, in your word processing application), your default mail application will open up with a blank message, ready for you to write. However, if you have more than one mail application installed, the wrong mail application might open up. You can fix this by changing which one is the default email application:
Choose which email client you would like to be used by default by changing the Mail option.
Viruses are unlikely to infect your computer, but could infect the computers of people you email.
Do I need to scan my emails for viruses?
Viruses are programs that cause problems if they manage to find their way onto your computer. A common way of them getting onto your computer is through email messages.
Viruses that can affect computers running Linux are quite rare, so you are unlikely to get a virus through email or otherwise. If you receive an email with a virus hidden in it, it will probably have no effect on your computer. As such, you probably don’t need to scan your email for viruses.
You may, however, wish to scan your email for viruses in case you happen to forward a virus from one person to another. For example, if one of your friends has a Windows computer with a virus and sends you a virus-infected email, and you then forward that email to another friend with a Windows computer, then the second friend might get the virus too. You could install an anti-virus application to scan your emails to prevent this, but it’s unlikely to happen and most people using Windows and Mac OS have anti-virus software of their own anyway.

Knowing your IP address can help you troubleshoot network problems.
Find your IP address
Knowing your IP address can help you troubleshoot problems with your internet connection. You may be surprised to learn that you have two IP addresses: an IP address for your computer on the internal network and an IP address for your computer on the internet.
Find your internal (network) IP address
Open the Activities overview and start typing Network.
Click on Network to open the panel.
Choose which connection, Wi-Fi or Wired, from the left pane.
The IP address for a wired connection will be displayed on the right.
settings
Click the  button to see the IP address for the wireless network in the Details panel.
Find your external (internet) IP address
Visit whatismyipaddress.com.
The site will display your external IP address for you.
Depending on how your computer connects to the internet, both of these addresses may be the same.
You can control which programs can access the network. This helps to keep your computer secure.
Enable or block firewall access
Your system should be equipped with a firewall that allows it to block programs from being accessed by other people on the internet or your network. This helps to keep your computer secure.
Many applications can use your network connection. For instance, you can share files or let someone view your desktop remotely when connected to a network. Depending on how your computer is set up, you may need to adjust the firewall to allow these services to work as intended.
Each program that provides network services uses a specific network port. To enable other computers on the network to access a service, you may need to “open” its assigned port on the firewall:
Go to Activities in the top left corner of the screen and start your firewall application. You may need to install a firewall manager yourself if you can’t find one (for example, Firestarter or GUFW).
Open or disable the port for your network service, depending on whether you want people to be able to access it or not. Which port you need to change will depend on the service.
Save or apply the changes, following any additional instructions given by the firewall tool.
You need to specify the right network port to enable/disable network access for a program with your firewall.
Commonly-used network ports
This is a list of network ports commonly used by applications that provide network services, like file sharing or remote desktop viewing. You can change your system’s firewall to block or allow access to these applications. There are thousands of ports in use, so this table isn’t complete.
Port
Description
5353/udp
mDNS, Avahi
Allows systems to find each other, and describe which services they offer, without you having to specify the details manually.
631/udp
Printing
Allows you to send print jobs to a printer over the network.
631/tcp
Allows you to share your printer with other people over the network.
5298/tcp
Presence
Allows you to advertise your instant messaging status to other people on the network, such as “online” or “busy”.
5900/tcp
Remote desktop
Allows you to share your desktop so other people can view it or provide remote assistance.
3689/tcp
Music sharing (DAAP)
Allows you to share your music library with others on your network.
Using a static IP address can make it easier to provide some network services from your computer.
Create a connection with a fixed IP address
Most networks will automatically assign an IP address and other details to your computer when you connect to the network. These details can change periodically, but you might want to have a fixed IP address for the computer so you always know what its address is (for example, if it is a file server).
To give your computer a fixed (static) IP address:
Find the network connection that you want to have a fixed address. Click the  button next to the network connection. For a Wi-Fi connection, the  button will be located next to the active network.
Select the IPv4 or IPv6 tab and change the Method to Manual.

You may need to install Flash to be able to view websites like YouTube, which display videos and interactive web pages.
Install the Flash plug-in
Flash is a plug-in for your web browser that allows you to watch videos and use interactive web pages on some websites. Some websites won’t work without Flash.
If you do not have Flash installed, you will probably see a message telling you so when you visit a website that needs it. Flash is available as a free (but not open-source) download for most web browsers. Most Linux distributions have a version of Flash that you can install through their software installer (package manager) too.
If Flash is available from the software installer:
Open the software installer application and search for flash.
Look for the Adobe Flash plug-in, Adobe Flash Player or similar and click to install it.
If you have any web browser windows open, close them and then re-open them. The web browser should realize that Flash is installed when you open it again and you should now be able to view websites using Flash.
If Flash is not available from the software installer:
Go to the Flash Player download website. Your browser and operating system should be automatically detected.
Click where it says Select version to download and choose the type of software installer that works for your Linux distribution. If you don’t know which to use, choose the .tar.gz option.
Look at the installation instructions for Flash to learn how to install it for your web browser.
Open-source alternatives to Flash
A handful of free, open-source alternatives to Flash are available. These tend to work better than the Flash plug-in in some ways (for example, by handling sound playback better), but worse in others (for example, by not being able to display some of the more complicated Flash pages on the web).
You might like to try one of these if you are dissatisfied with the Flash player, or if you would like to use as much open-source software as possible on your computer. Here are a few of the options:

The unique identifier assigned to network hardware.
What is a MAC address?
A MAC address is the unique identifier that is assigned by the manufacturer to a piece of network hardware (like a wireless card or an ethernet card). MAC stands for Media Access Control, and each identifier is intended to be unique to a particular device.
A MAC address consists of six sets of two characters, each separated by a colon. 00:1B:44:11:3A:B7 is an example of a MAC address.
To identify the MAC address of your own network hardware:
Choose which device, Wi-Fi or Wired, from the left pane.
The MAC address for the wired device will be displayed as the Hardware Address on the right.
Click the  button to see the MAC address for the wireless device displayed as the Hardware Address in the Details panel.
In practice, you may need to modify or “spoof” a MAC address. For example, some internet service providers may require that a specific MAC address be used to access their service. If the network card stops working, and you need to swap a new card in, the service won’t work anymore. In such cases, you would need to spoof the MAC address.
You may have to enter network settings if they don’t get assigned automatically.
Manually set network settings
If your network doesn’t automatically assign network settings to your computer, you may have to manually enter the settings yourself. This topic assumes that you already know the correct settings to use. If not, you may need to ask your network administrator or look at the settings of your router or network switch.
To manually set your network settings:
If you plug in to the network with a cable, click Network. Otherwise click Wi-Fi.
Make sure that your wireless card is turned on or a network cable is plugged in.
Click the button.
For a Wi-Fi connection, the  button will be located next to the active network.
Click Apply. If you are not connected to the network, open the system menu from the right side of the top bar and connect. Test the network settings by trying to visit a website or look at shared files on the network, for example.
Use your phone or Internet stick to connect to the mobile broadband network.
Connect to mobile broadband
You can set up a connection to a cellular (3G) network with your computer’s built-in 3G modem, your mobile phone, or an Internet stick.
Most phones have a setting called USB tethering that requires no setup on the computer, and is generally the better method to connect to the cellular network.
If you do not have a built-in 3G modem, connect your phone or Internet stick to a USB port on your computer.
Select  Mobile Broadband Off. The Mobile Broadband section of the menu will expand.
If Mobile Broadband does not appear in the system menu, ensure that your device is not set to connect as Mass Storage.
Select Connect. If you are connecting for the first time, the Set up a Mobile Broadband Connection wizard is launched. The opening screen displays a list of required information. Click Next.
Choose your provider’s country or region from the list. Click Next.
Choose your provider from the list. Click Next.
Select a plan according to the type of device you are connecting. This will determine the Access Point Name. Click Next.
Confirm the settings you have selected by clicking Apply. The wizard will close and the Network panel will display the properties of your connection.
You can save settings (like the password) for a network connection so that everyone who uses the computer will be able to connect to it.
Other users can’t connect to the internet
When you set up a network connection, all other users on your computer will normally be able to use it. If the connection information is not shared, you should check the connection settings.
Select Wi-Fi from the list on the left.
Click the  button to open the connection details.
Select Identity from the pane on the left.
At the bottom of the Identity panel, check the Make available to other users option to allow other users to use the network connection.
Press Apply to save the changes.
Other users of the computer will now be able to use this connection without entering any further details.
Any user can change this setting.
You need to uncheck the Available to all users option in the network connection settings.
Other users can’t edit the network connections
If you can edit a network connection but other users on your computer can’t, you may have set the connection to be available to all users. This makes it so that everyone on the computer can connect using that connection.

A proxy is an intermediary for web traffic, it can be used for accessing web services anonymously, for control or security purposes.
Define proxy settings
What is a proxy?
A web proxy filters websites that you look at, it receives requests from your web browser to fetch web pages and their elements, and following a policy will decide to pass them you back. They are commonly used in businesses and at public wireless hotspots to control what websites you can look at, prevent you from accessing the internet without logging in, or to do security checks on websites.
Change proxy method
Select Network proxy from the list on the left.
Choose which proxy method you want to use from:
None
The applications will use a direct connection to fetch the content from the web.
Manual
For each proxied protocol, define the address of a proxy and port for the protocols. The protocols are HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and SOCKS.
Automatic
A URL pointing to a resource, which contains the appropriate configuration for your system.
Applications that use the network connection will use your specified proxy settings.

General tips to keep in mind when using the internet.
Staying safe on the internet
A possible reason for why you are using Linux is the robust security that it is known for. One reason that Linux is relatively safe from malware and viruses is due to the lower number of people who use it. Viruses are targeted at popular operating systems, like Windows, that have an extremely large user base. Linux is also very secure due to its open source nature, which allows experts to modify and enhance the security features included with each distribution.
Despite the measures taken to ensure that your installation of Linux is secure, there are always vulnerabilities. As an average user on the internet you can still be susceptible to:
Phishing Scams (websites and emails that try to obtain sensitive information through deception)
Forwarding malicious emails
Applications with malicious intent (viruses)
Unauthorized remote/local network access
To stay safe online, keep in mind the following tips:
Be wary of emails, attachments, or links that were sent from people you do not know.
If a website’s offer is too good to be true, or asks for sensitive information that seems unnecessary, then think twice about what information you are submitting and the potential consequences if that information is compromised by identity thieves or other criminals.
Be careful in providing root level permissions to any application, especially ones that you have not used before or which are not well-known. Providing anyone or anything with root level permissions puts your computer at high risk to exploitation.
Make sure you are only running necessary remote-access services. Having SSH or VNC running can be useful, but also leaves your computer open to intrusion if not secured properly. Consider using a firewall to help protect your computer from intrusion.
Antivirus software, basic firewalls, firewall ports…
Keeping safe on the internet
Other things might be downloading, you could have a poor connection, or it could be a busy time of day.
The internet seems slow
If you are using the internet and it seems slow, there are a number of things that could be causing the slow down.
Try closing your web browser and then re-opening it, and disconnecting from the internet and then reconnecting again. (Doing this resets a lot of things that might be causing the internet to run slowly.)
Busy time of day
Internet service providers commonly setup internet connections so that they are shared between several households. Even though you connect separately, through your own phone line or cable connection, the connection to the rest of the internet at the telephone exchange might actually be shared. If this is the case and lots of your neighbors are using the internet at the same time as you, you might notice a slow-down. You’re most likely to experience this at times when your neighbors are probably on the internet (in the evenings, for example).
Downloading lots of things at once
If you or someone else using your internet connection are downloading several files at once, or watching videos, the internet connection might not be fast enough to keep up with the demand. In this case, it will feel slower.
Unreliable connection
Some internet connections are just unreliable, especially temporary ones or those in high demand areas. If you are in a busy coffee shop or a conference center, the internet connection might be too busy or simply unreliable.
Low wireless connection signal
If you are connected to the internet by wireless (Wi-Fi), check the network icon on the top bar to see if you have good wireless signal. If not, the internet may be slow because you don’t have a very strong signal.
Using a slower mobile internet connection
If you have a mobile internet connection and notice that it is slow, you may have moved into an area where signal reception is poor. When this happens, the internet connection will automatically switch from a fast “mobile broadband” connection like 3G to a more reliable, but slower, connection like GPRS.
Web browser has a problem
Sometimes web browsers encounter a problem that makes them run slow. This could be for any number of reasons — you could have visited a website that the browser struggled to load, or you might have had the browser open for a long time, for example. Try closing all of the browser’s windows and then opening the browser again to see if this makes a difference.
Set up a VPN connection to a local network over the internet.
Connect to a VPN
A VPN (or Virtual Private Network) is a way of connecting to a local network over the internet. For example, say you want to connect to the local network at your workplace while you’re on a business trip. You would find an internet connection somewhere (like at a hotel) and then connect to your workplace’s VPN. It would be as if you were directly connected to the network at work, but the actual network connection would be through the hotel’s internet connection. VPN connections are usually encrypted to prevent people from accessing the local network you’re connecting to without logging in.
There are a number of different types of VPN. You may have to install some extra software depending on what type of VPN you’re connecting to. Find out the connection details from whoever is in charge of the VPN and see which VPN client you need to use. Then, go to the software installer application and search for the NetworkManager package which works with your VPN (if there is one) and install it.
If there isn’t a NetworkManager package for your type of VPN, you will probably have to download and install some client software from the company that provides the VPN software. You’ll probably have to follow some different instructions to get that working.
To set up the VPN connection:
At the bottom of the list on the left, click the + button to add a new connection.
Choose VPN in the interface list.
Choose which kind of VPN connection you have.
Fill in the VPN connection details, then press Add once you are finished.
When you have finished setting up the VPN, open the system menu from the right side of the top bar, click VPN off and select Connect. You may need to enter a password for the connection before it is established. Once the connection is made, you will see a lock shaped icon in the top bar.
Hopefully you will successfully connect to the VPN. If not, you may need to double-check the VPN settings you entered. You can do this from the Network panel that you used to create the connection. Select the VPN connection from the list, then press the  button to review the settings.
To disconnect from the VPN, click the system menu on the top bar and click Turn Off under the name of your VPN connection.
An IP Address is like a phone number for your computer.
What is an IP address?
“IP address” stands for Internet Protocol address, and each device that is connected to a network (like the internet) has one.
An IP address is similar to your phone number. Your phone number is a unique set of numbers that identifies your phone so that other people can call you. Similarly, an IP address is a unique set of numbers that identifies your computer so that it can send and receive data with other computers.
Currently, most IP addresses consist of four sets of numbers, each separated by a period. 192.168.1.42 is an example of an IP address.
An IP address can either be dynamic or static. Dynamic IP addresses are temporarily assigned each time your computer connects to a network. Static IP addresses are fixed, and do not change. Dynamic IP addresses are more common that static addresses — static addresses are typically only used when there is a special need for them, such as in the administration of a server.
To set up most wired network connections, all you need to do is plug in a network cable.
Connect to a wired (Ethernet) network
To set up most wired network connections, all you need to do is plug in a network cable. The wired network icon () is displayed on the top bar with three dots while the connection is being established. The dots disappear when you are connected.
If this does not happen, you should first of all make sure that your network cable is plugged in. One end of the cable should be plugged into the rectangular Ethernet (network) port on your computer, and the other end should be plugged into a switch, router, network wall socket or similar (depending on the network setup you have). Sometimes, a light beside the Ethernet port will indicate that it is plugged in and active.
You cannot plug one computer directly into another one with a network cable (at least, not without some extra setting-up). To connect two computers, you should plug them both into a network hub, router or switch.
If you are still not connected, your network may not support automatic setup (DHCP). In this case you will have to configure it manually.
Wired internet connections, Fixed IP addresses…
Wired networking
Use an ad-hoc network to allow other devices to connect to your computer and its network connections.
Create a wireless hotspot
You can use your computer as a wireless hotspot. This allows other devices to connect to you without a separate network, and allows you to share an internet connection you’ve made with another interface, such as to a wired network or over the cellular network.
Select  Wi-Fi Not Connected or the name of the wireless network to which you are already connected. The Wi-Fi section of the menu will expand.
Click Wi-Fi Settings.
Press the menu button in the top-right corner of the window and select Turn On Wi-Fi Hotspot….
If you are already connected to a wireless network, you will be asked if you want to disconnect from that network. A single wireless adapter can connect to or create only one network at a time. Click Turn On to confirm.
A network name (SSID) and security key are automatically generated. The network name will be based on the name of your computer. Other devices will need this information to connect to the hotspot you’ve just created.
Open Network Settings and switch Airplane Mode to on.
Turn off wireless (airplane mode)
If you have your computer on an airplane (or some other area where wireless connections are not allowed), you should switch off your wireless. You may also want to switch off your wireless for other reasons (to save battery power, for example).
Using Airplane Mode will completely turn off all wireless connections, including Wi-Fi, 3G and Bluetooth connections.
To turn on airplane mode:
Open the Activities overview and start typing Wi-Fi.
Click on Wi-Fi to open the panel.
Switch the Airplane Mode switch to on. This will turn off your wireless connection until you disable airplane mode again.
You can turn off your Wi-Fi connection from the system menu by clicking on the connection name and choosing Turn Off.
Get on the internet — wirelessly.
Connect to a wireless network
If you have a wireless-enabled computer, you can connect to a wireless network that is within range to get access to the internet, view shared files on the network, and so on.
Select  Wi-Fi Not Connected. The Wi-Fi section of the menu will expand.
Click Select Network.
Click the name of the network you want, then click Connect.
If the name of the network is not in the list, try clicking More to see if the network is further down the list. If you still do not see the network, you may be out of range, or the network might be hidden.
If the network is protected by a password (encryption key), enter the password when prompted and click Connect.
If you do not know the key, it may be written on the underside of the wireless router or base station, or in its instruction manual, or you may have to ask the person who administers the wireless network.
The network icon will change appearance as the computer attempts to connect to the network.
If the connection is successful, the icon will change to a dot with several curved bars above it (). More bars indicate a stronger connection to the network. Fewer bars mean the connection is weaker and might not be very reliable.
If the connection is not successful, you may be asked for your password again or it might just tell you that the connection has been disconnected. There are a number of things that could have caused this to happen. You could have entered the wrong password, the wireless signal could be too weak, or your computer’s wireless card might have a problem, for example. See  for more help.
A stronger connection to a wireless network does not necessarily mean that you have a faster internet connection, or that you will have faster download speeds. The wireless connection connects your computer to the device which provides the internet connection (like a router or modem), but the two connections are actually different, and so will run at different speeds.
You might have low signal, or the network might not be letting you connect properly.
Why does my wireless network keep disconnecting?
You may find that you have been disconnected from a wireless network even though you wanted to stay connected. Your computer will normally try to reconnect to the network as soon as this happens (the network icon on the top bar will display three dots if it is trying to reconnect), but it can be annoying, especially if you were using the internet at the time.
Weak wireless signal
A common reason for being disconnected from a wireless network is that you have low signal. Wireless networks have a limited range, so if you are too far away from the wireless base station you may not be able to get a strong enough signal to maintain a connection. Walls and other objects between you and the base station can also weaken the signal.
The network icon on the top bar displays how strong your wireless signal is. If the signal looks low, try moving closer to the wireless base station.
Network connection not being established properly
Sometimes, when you connect to a wireless network, it may appear that you have successfully connected at first, but then you will be disconnected soon after. This normally happens because your computer was only partially successful in connecting to the network — it managed to establish a connection, but was unable to finalize the connection for some reason and so was disconnected.
A possible reason for this is that you entered the wrong wireless passphrase, or that your computer was not allowed on the network (because the network requires a username to log in, for example).
Unreliable wireless hardware/drivers
Some wireless network hardware can be a little unreliable. Wireless networks are complicated, so wireless cards and base stations occasionally run into minor problems and may drop connections. This is annoying, but it happens quite regularly with many devices. If you are disconnected from wireless connections from time to time, this may be the only reason. If it happens very regularly, you may want to consider getting some different hardware.
Busy wireless networks
Wireless networks in busy places (in universities and coffee shops, for example) often have many computers trying to connect to them at once. Sometimes these networks get too busy and may not be able to handle all of the computers that are trying to connect, so some of them get disconnected.
The wireless could be turned off or broken, or you may be trying to connect to a hidden network.
I can’t see my wireless network in the list
There are a number of reasons why you might not be able to see your wireless network on the list of available networks from the system menu.
If no networks are shown in the list, your wireless hardware could be turned off, or it may not be working properly. Make sure it is turned on.
You could be out of range of the network. Try moving closer to the wireless base station/router and see if the network appears in the list after a while.
The list of wireless networks takes time to update. If you have just turned on your computer or moved to a different location, wait for a minute or so and then check if the network has appeared in the list.
The network could be hidden. You need to connect in a different way if it is a hidden network.
Connect to a wireless network that is not displayed in the network list.
Connect to a hidden wireless network
It is possible to set up a wireless network so that it is “hidden.” Hidden networks won’t show up in the list of wireless networks displayed in the Network settings. To connect to a hidden wireless network:
Press the menu button in the top-right corner of the window and select Connect to Hidden Network….
In the window that appears, select a previously-connected hidden network using the Connection drop-down list, or New for a new one.
For a new connection, type the network name and choose the type of wireless security from the Wi-Fi security drop-down list.
Enter the password or other security details.
Click Connect.
You may have to check the settings of the wireless access point or router to see what the network name is. If you don’t have the network name (SSID), you can use the BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier, the access point’s MAC address), which looks something like 02:00:01:02:03:04 and can usually be found on the underside of the access point.
You should also check the security settings for the wireless access point. Look for terms like WEP and WPA.
You may think that hiding your wireless network will improve security by preventing people who don’t know about it from connecting. In practice, this is not the case; the network is slightly harder to find but it is still detectable.
Double-check the password, and other things to try.
I’ve entered the correct password, but I still can’t connect
If you’re sure that you entered the correct wireless password but you still can’t successfully connect to a wireless network, try some of the following:
Double-check that you have the correct password
Passwords are case-sensitive (it matters whether they have capital or lower-case letters), so check that you didn’t get the case of one of the letters wrong.
Try the hex or ASCII pass key
The password you enter can also be represented in a different way — as a string of characters in hexadecimal (numbers 0-9 and letters a-f) called a pass key. Each password has an equivalent pass key. If you have access to the pass key as well as the password/passphrase, try typing the pass key instead. Make sure you select the correct wireless security option when asked for your password (for example, select WEP 40/128-bit Key if you’re typing the 40-character pass key for a WEP-encrypted connection).
Try turning your wireless card off and then on again
Sometimes wireless cards get stuck or experience a minor problem that means they won’t connect. Try turning the card off and then on again to reset it — see  for more information.
Check that you’re using the correct type of wireless security
When prompted for your wireless security password, you can choose which type of wireless security to use. Make sure you choose the one that is used by the router or wireless base station. This should be selected by default, but sometimes it will not be for some reason. If you don’t know which one it is, use trial and error to go through the different options.
Check that your wireless card is properly supported
Some wireless cards aren’t supported very well. They show up as a wireless connection, but they can’t connect to a network because their drivers lack the ability to do this. See if you can get an alternative wireless driver, or if you need to perform some extra set-up (like installing a different firmware). See  for more information.
Contributors to the Ubuntu documentation wiki
Some device drivers don’t work very well with certain wireless adapters, so you may need to find a better one.
Wireless network troubleshooter
Make sure that working device drivers are installed
In this step you can check to see if you can get working device drivers for your wireless adapter. A device driver is a piece of software which tells the computer how to make a hardware device work properly. Even though the wireless adapter has been recognized by the computer, it may not have drivers which work very well. You may be able to find different drivers for the wireless adapter which do work. Try some of the options below:
Check to see if your wireless adapter is on a list of supported devices.
Most Linux distributions keep a list of wireless devices that they have support for. Sometimes, these lists provide extra information on how to get the drivers for certain adapters working properly. Go to the list for your distribution (for example, Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora or openSUSE) and see if your make and model of wireless adapter is listed. You may be able to use some of the information there to get your wireless drivers working.
Look for restricted (binary) drivers.
Many Linux distributions only come with device drivers which are free and open source. This is because they cannot distribute drivers which are proprietary, or closed-source. If the correct driver for your wireless adapter is only available in a non-free, or “binary-only” version, it may not be installed by default. If this is the case, look on the wireless adapter manufacturer’s website to see if they have any Linux drivers.
Some Linux distributions have a tool that can download restricted drivers for you. If your distribution has one of these, use it to see if it can find any wireless drivers for you.
Use the Windows drivers for your adapter.
In general, you cannot use a device driver designed for one operating system (like Windows) on another operating system (like Linux). This is because they have different ways of handling devices. For wireless adapters, however, you can install a compatibility layer called NDISwrapper which lets you use some Windows wireless drivers on Linux. This is useful because wireless adapters almost always have Windows drivers available for them, whereas Linux drivers are sometimes not available. You can learn more about how to use NDISwrapper here. Note that not all wireless drivers can be used through NDISwrapper.
If none of these options work, you may want to try a different wireless adapter to see if you can get that working. USB wireless adapters are often quite cheap, and will plug into any computer. You should check that the adapter is compatible with your Linux distribution before buying it, though.
Even though your wireless adapter is connected, it may not have been recognized properly by the computer.
Wireless connection troubleshooter
Check that the wireless adapter was recognized
Even though the wireless adapter is connected to the computer, it may not have been recognized as a network device by the computer. In this step, you will check whether the device was recognized properly.
Open a Terminal window, type lshw -C network and press Enter. If this gives an error message, you may need to install the lshw program on your computer.
Look through the information that appeared and find the Wireless interface section. If your wireless adapter was detected properly, you should see something similar (but not identical) to this:
If a wireless device is listed, continue on to the Device Drivers step.
If a wireless device is not listed, the next steps you take will depend on the type of device that you use. Refer to the section below that is relevant to the type of wireless adapter that your computer has (internal PCI, USB, or PCMCIA).
PCI (internal) wireless adapter
Internal PCI adapters are the most common, and are found in most laptops made within the past few years. To check if your PCI wireless adapter was recognized:
Open a Terminal, type lspci and press Enter.
Look through the list of devices that is shown and find any that are marked Network controller or Ethernet controller. Several devices may be marked in this way; the one corresponding to your wireless adapter might include words like wireless, WLAN, wifi or 802.11. Here is an example of what the entry might look like:
Network controller: Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG [Golan] Network Connection
If you found your wireless adapter in the list, proceed to the Device Drivers step. If you didn’t find anything related to your wireless adapter, see the instructions below.
USB wireless adapter
Wireless adapters that plug into a USB port on your computer are less common. They can plug directly into a USB port, or may be connected by a USB cable. 3G/mobile broadband adapters look quite similar to wireless (Wi-Fi) adapters, so if you think you have a USB wireless adapter, double-check that it is not actually a 3G adapter. To check if your USB wireless adapter was recognized:
Open a Terminal, type lsusb and press Enter.
Look through the list of devices that is shown and find any that seem to refer to a wireless or network device. The one corresponding to your wireless adapter might include words like wireless, WLAN, wifi or 802.11. Here is an example of what the entry might look like:
Bus 005 Device 009: ID 12d1:140b Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. EC1260 Wireless Data Modem HSD USB Card
Checking for a PCMCIA device
PCMCIA wireless adapters are typically rectangular cards which slot into the side of your laptop. They are more commonly found in older computers. To check if your PCMCIA adapter was recognized:
Start your computer without the wireless adapter plugged in.
Open a Terminal and type the following, then press Enter:
tail -f /var/log/messages
This will display a list of messages related to your computer’s hardware, and will automatically update if anything to do with your hardware changes.
Insert your wireless adapter into the PCMCIA slot and see what changes in the Terminal window. The changes should include some information about your wireless adapter. Look through them and see if you can identify it.
To stop the command from running in the Terminal, press CtrlC. After you have done that, you can close the Terminal if you like.
If you found any information about your wireless adapter, proceed to the Device Drivers step. If you didn’t find anything related to your wireless adapter, see the instructions below.
Wireless adapter was not recognized
If your wireless adapter was not recognized, it might not be working properly or the correct drivers may not be installed for it. How you check to see if there are any drivers you can install will depend on which Linux distribution you are using (like Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora or openSUSE).
To get specific help, look at the support options on your distribution’s website. These might include mailing lists and web chats where you can ask about your wireless adapter, for example.
You may need details such as the model number of your wireless adapter in subsequent troubleshooting steps.
Gather information about your network hardware
In this step, you will collect information about your wireless network device. The way you fix many wireless problems depends on the make and model number of the wireless adapter, so you will need to make a note of these details. It can also be helpful to have some of the items that came with your computer too, like device driver installation discs. Look for the following items, if you still have them:
The packaging and instructions for your wireless devices (especially the user guide for your router)
The disc containing drivers for your wireless adapter (even if it only contains Windows drivers)
The manufacturers and model numbers of your computer, wireless adapter and router. This information can usually be found on the underside or reverse of the device.
Any version or revision numbers that may be printed on your wireless network devices or their packaging. These can be especially helpful, so look carefully.
Anything on the driver disc that identifies either the device itself, its “firmware” version, or the components (chipset) it uses.
If possible, try to get access to an alternative working internet connection so that you can download software and drivers if necessary. (Plugging your computer directly into the router with an Ethernet network cable is one way of providing this, but only plug it in when you need to.)
Once you have as many of these items as possible, click Next.
Make sure that simple network settings are correct and prepare for the next few troubleshooting steps.
Perform an initial connection check
In this step you will check some basic information about your wireless network connection. This is to make sure that your networking problem isn’t caused by a relatively simple issue, like the wireless connection being turned off, and to prepare for the next few troubleshooting steps.
Make sure that your laptop is not connected to a wired internet connection.
If you have an external wireless adapter (such as a USB adapter, or a PCMCIA card that plugs into your laptop), make sure that it is firmly inserted into the proper slot on your computer.
If your wireless card is inside your computer, make sure that the wireless switch is turned on (if it has one). Laptops often have wireless switches that you can toggle by pressing a combination of keyboard keys.
Open the system menu from the right side of the top bar and select the Wi-Fi network, then select Wi-Fi Settings. Make sure that the Wi-Fi switch is set to on. You should also check that Airplane Mode is not switched on.
Open the Terminal, type nmcli device and press Enter.
This will display information about your network interfaces and connection status. Look down the list of information and see if there is an item related to the wireless network adapter. If the state is connected, it means that the adapter is working and connected to your wireless router.
If you are connected to your wireless router, but you still cannot access the internet, your router may not be set up correctly, or your Internet Service Provider (ISP) maybe experiencing some technical problems. Review your router and ISP setup guides to make sure the settings are correct, or contact your ISP for support.
If the information from nmcli device did not indicate that you were connected to the network, click Next to proceed to the next portion of the troubleshooting guide.
Identify and fix problems with wireless connections.
This is a step-by-step troubleshooting guide to help you identify and fix wireless problems. If you cannot connect to a wireless network for some reason, try following the instructions here.

To get started, click on the Next link at the top right of the page. This link, and others like it on following pages, will take you through each step in the guide.
Using the command line
Some of the instructions in this guide ask you to type commands into the command line (Terminal). You can find the Terminal application in the Activities overview.
If you are not familiar with using a command line, don’t worry — this guide will direct you at each step. All you need to remember is that commands are case-sensitive (so you must type them exactly as they appear here), and to press Enter after typing each command to run it.
WEP and WPA are ways of encrypting data on wireless networks.
What do WEP and WPA mean?
WEP and WPA (along with WPA2) are names for different encryption tools used to secure your wireless connection. Encryption scrambles the network connection so that no one can “listen in” to it and look at which web pages you are viewing, for example. WEP stands for Wired Equivalent Privacy, and WPA stands for Wireless Protected Access. WPA2 is the second version of the WPA standard.
Using some encryption is always better than using none, but WEP is the least secure of these standards, and you should not use it if you can avoid it. WPA2 is the most secure of the three. If your wireless card and router support WPA2, that is what you should use when setting up your wireless network.

Automatically control screen brightness to reduce battery use.
Enable automatic brightness
If your computer has an integrated light sensor, it can be used to automatically control screen brightness. This ensures that the screen is always easy to see in different ambient light conditions, and helps to reduce battery consumption.
In the Power Saving section, ensure that the Automatic brightness switch is set to on.
To disable automatic screen brightness, switch it to off.
Configure your computer to suspend automatically.
Set up automatic suspend
You can configure your computer to automatically suspend when idle. Different intervals can be specified for running on battery or plugged in.
In the Suspend amp; Power Button section, click Automatic suspend.
Choose On Battery Power or Plugged In, set the switch to on, and select a Delay. Both options can be configured.
On a desktop computer, there is one option labeled When Idle.
The battery life displayed when you click on the battery icon is an estimate.
The estimated battery life is wrong
When you check the remaining battery life, you may find that the time remaining that it reports is different to how long the battery actually lasts. This is because the amount of remaining battery life can only be estimated. Normally, the estimates improve over time.
In order to estimate the remaining battery life, a number of factors must be taken into account. One is the amount of power currently being used by the computer: power consumption varies depending on how many programs you have open, which devices are plugged in, and whether you are running any intensive tasks (like watching high-definition video or converting music files, for example). This changes from moment to moment, and is difficult to predict.
Another factor is how the battery discharges. Some batteries lose charge faster the emptier they get. Without precise knowledge of how the battery discharges, only a rough estimate of remaining battery life can be made.
As the battery discharges, the power manager will figure out its discharge properties and will learn how to make better estimates of battery life. They will never be completely accurate, though.
If you get a completely ridiculous battery life estimate (say, hundreds of days), the power manager is probably missing some of the data it needs to make a sensible estimate.
If you unplug the power and run the laptop on battery for a while, then plug it in and let it recharge again, the power manager should be able to get the data it needs.
Tips to reduce the power consumption of your computer.
Use less power and improve battery life
Computers can use a lot of power. By using some simple energy-saving strategies, you can reduce your energy bill and help the environment.
General tips
Suspend your computer when you are not using it. This significantly reduces the amount of power it uses, and it can be woken up very quickly.
Turn off the computer when you will not be using it for longer periods. Some people worry that turning off a computer regularly may cause it to wear out faster, but this is not the case.
Use the Power panel in Settings to change your power settings. There are a number of options that will help to save power: you can automatically blank the screen after a certain time, reduce the screen brightness, and have the computer automatically suspend if you have not used it for a certain period of time.
Turn off any external devices (like printers and scanners) when you are not using them.
Laptops, netbooks, and other devices with batteries
Reduce the screen brightness. Powering the screen accounts for a significant fraction of a laptop power consumption.
Most laptops have buttons on the keyboard (or a keyboard shortcut) that you can use to reduce the brightness.
If you do not need an Internet connection for a little while, turn off the wireless or Bluetooth cards. These devices work by broadcasting radio waves, which takes quite a bit of power.
Some computers have a physical switch that can be used to turn it off, whereas others have a keyboard shortcut that you can use instead. You can turn it on again when you need it.
More advanced tips
Reduce the number of tasks that are running in the background. Computers use more power when they have more work to do.
Most of your running applications do very little when you are not actively using them. However, applications that frequently grab data from the internet or play music or movies can impact your power consumption.
Tips such as “Do not let the battery charge get too low”.
Get the most out of your laptop battery
As laptop batteries age, they get worse at storing charge and their capacity gradually decreases. There are a few techniques that you can use to prolong their useful lifetime, although you should not expect a big difference.
Do not let the battery run all the way down. Always recharge before the battery gets very low, although most batteries have built-in safeguards to prevent the battery running too low. Recharging when it is only partially discharged is more efficient, but recharging when it is only slightly discharged is worse for the battery.
Heat has a detrimental effect on the charging efficiency of the battery. Do not let the battery get any warmer than it has to.
Batteries age even if you leave them in storage. There is little advantage in buying a replacement battery at the same time as you get the original battery — always buy replacements when you need them.
This advice applies specifically to Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) batteries, which are the most common type. Other types of battery may benefit from different treatment.
Some laptops intentionally slow down when they are running on battery.
Why is my laptop slow when it is on battery?
Some laptops intentionally slow down when they are running on battery in order to conserve power. The processor (CPU) in the laptop switches to a slower speed, and processors use less power when running slower, so the battery should last longer.
This feature is called CPU frequency scaling.
Tweaks from the manufacturer and differing battery life estimates may be the cause of this problem.
Why do I have less battery life than I did on Windows/Mac OS?
Some computers appear to have a shorter battery life when running on Linux than they do when running Windows or Mac OS. One reason for this is that computer vendors install special software for Windows/Mac OS that optimizes various hardware/software settings for a given model of computer. These tweaks are often highly specific, and may not be documented, so including them in Linux is difficult.
Unfortunately, there is not an easy way of applying these tweaks yourself without knowing exactly what they are. You may find that using some power-saving methods helps, though. If your computer has a variable-speed processor, you might find that changing its settings is also useful.
Another possible reason for the discrepancy is that the method of estimating battery life is different on Windows/Mac OS than on Linux. The actual battery life could be exactly the same, but the different methods give different estimates.
Laptops go to sleep when you close the lid, in order to save power.
Why does my computer turn off when I close the lid?
When you close the lid of your laptop, your computer will suspend in order to save power. This means that the computer is not actually turned off — it has just gone to sleep. You can resume it by opening the lid. If it does not resume, try clicking the mouse or pressing a key. If that still does not work, press the power button.
Some computers are unable to suspend properly, normally because their hardware is not completely supported by the operating system (for example, the Linux drivers are incomplete). In this case, you may find that you are unable to resume your computer after you have closed the lid. You can try to fix the problem with suspend, or you can prevent the computer from trying to suspend when you close the lid.
Stop the computer from suspending when the lid is closed
These instructions will only work if you are using systemd. Contact your distribution for more information.
You need to have Tweaks installed on your computer to change this setting.
Install Tweaks
If you do not want the computer to suspend when you close the lid, you can change the setting for that behavior.
Be very careful if you change this setting. Some laptops can overheat if they are left running with the lid closed, especially if they are in a confined place like a backpack.
Open the Activities overview and start typing Tweaks.
Click Tweaks to open the application.
Select the General tab.
Switch the Suspend when laptop lid is closed switch to off.
Close the Tweaks window.
Some fan-control software could be missing, or your laptop may be running hot.
The laptop fan is always running
If cooling fan in your laptop is always running, it could be that the hardware that controls the cooling system in the laptop is not very well supported in Linux. Some laptops need extra software to control their cooling fans efficiently, but this software may not be installed (or available for Linux at all) and so the fans just run at full speed all of the time.
If this is the case, you may be able to change some settings or install extra software that allows full control of the fan. For example, vaiofand can be installed to control the fans of some Sony VAIO laptops. Installing this software is quite a technical process which is highly dependent on the make and model of your laptop, so you may wish to seek specific advice on how to do it for your computer.
It is also possible that your laptop just produces a lot of heat. This does not necessarily mean that it is overheating; it might just need the fan to run at full speed all of the time to allow it to stay cool enough. If this is the case, you have little option but to let the fan run at full speed all of the time. You can sometimes buy additional cooling accessories for your laptop which may help.
Computers usually get warm, but if they get too hot they can overheat, which can be damaging.
My computer gets really hot
Most computers get warm after a while, and some can get quite hot. This is normal: it is simply part of the way that the computer cools itself. However, if your computer gets very warm it could be a sign that it is overheating, which can potentially cause damage.
Most laptops get reasonably warm once you have been using them for a while. It is generally nothing to worry about — computers produce a lot of heat and laptops are very compact, so they need to remove their heat rapidly and their outer casing warms up as a result. Some laptops do get too hot, however, and may be uncomfortable to use. This is normally the result of a poorly-designed cooling system. You can sometimes get additional cooling accessories which fit to the bottom of the laptop and provide more efficient cooling.
If you have a desktop computer which feels hot to the touch, it may have insufficient cooling. If this concerns you, you can buy extra cooling fans or check that the cooling fans and vents are free from dust and other blockages. You might want to consider putting the computer in a better-ventilated area too — if kept in confined spaces (for example, in a cupboard), the cooling system in the computer may not be able to remove heat and circulate cool air fast enough.
Some people are concerned about the health risks of using hot laptops. There are suggestions that prolonged use of a hot laptop on your lap might possibly reduce (male) fertility, and there are reports of minor burns being suffered too (in extreme cases). If you are concerned about these potential problems, you may wish to consult a medical practitioner for advice. Of course, you can simply choose not to rest the laptop on your lap.
Most modern computers will shut themselves down if they get too hot, to prevent themselves from becoming damaged. If your computer keeps shutting down, this might be the reason. If your computer is overheating, you will probably need to get it repaired.
Allowing the battery to completely discharge is bad for it.
Why did my computer turn off when the battery got to 10%?
When the charge level of the battery gets too low, your computer will automatically turn off. It does this to make sure that the battery does not completely discharge, since this is bad for the battery. If the battery just ran out, the computer would not have time to shut down properly either.
Bear in mind that when your computer automatically turns off, your applications and documents are not saved. To avoid losing your work, save it before the battery gets too low.
Some wireless devices have problems handling when your computer is suspended and does not resume properly.
I have no wireless network when I wake up my computer
If you have suspended your computer, you may find that your wireless internet connection does not work when you resume it again. This happens when the driver for the wireless device does not fully support certain power saving features. Typically, the wireless connection fails to turn on properly when the computer is resumed.
If this happens, try switching your wireless off and then back on again:
Switch the Wi-Fi switch at the top-right of the window to off and then on again.
If the wireless still does not work, switch the Airplane Mode switch to on and then switch it off again.
If this does not work, restarting your computer should make the wireless work again. If you are still having problems after that, connect to the internet using an Ethernet cable and update your computer.
Your computer will work, but you might need a different power cable or a travel adapter.
Will my computer work with a power supply in another country?
Different countries use power supplies at different voltages (usually 110V or 220-240V) and AC frequencies (usually 50 Hz or 60 Hz). Your computer should work with a power supply in a different country as long as you have an appropriate power adapter. You may also need to flip a switch.
If you have a laptop, all you should need to do is get the right plug for your power adapter. Some laptops come packaged with more than one plug for their adapter, so you may already have the right one. If not, plugging your existing one into a standard travel adapter will suffice.
If you have a desktop computer, you can also get a cable with a different plug, or use a travel adapter. In this case, however, you may need to change the voltage switch on the computer’s power supply, if there is one. Many computers do not have a switch like this, and will happily work with either voltage. Look at the back of the computer and find the socket that the power cable plugs into. Somewhere nearby, there may be a small switch marked “110V” or “230V” (for example). Switch it if you need to.
Be careful when changing power cables or using travel adapters. Switch everything off first if you can.

Some computer hardware causes problems with suspend.
Why does my computer not turn back on after I suspended it?
If you suspend your computer, then try to resume it, you may find that it does not work as you expected. This could be because suspend is not supported properly by your hardware.
My computer is suspended and is not resuming
If you suspend your computer and then press a key or click the mouse, it should wake up and display a screen asking for your password. If this does not happen, try pressing the power button (do not hold it in, just press it once).
If this still does not help, make sure that your computer’s monitor is switched on and try pressing a key on the keyboard again.
As a last resort, turn off the computer by holding in the power button for 5-10 seconds, although you will lose any unsaved work by doing this. You should then be able to turn on the computer again.
If this happens every time you suspend your computer, the suspend feature may not work with your hardware.
If your computer loses power and does not have an alternative power supply (such as a working battery), it will switch off.
My wireless connection (or other hardware) does not work when I wake up my computer
If you suspend your computer and then resume it again, you may find that your internet connection, mouse, or some other device does not work properly. This could be because the driver for the device does not properly support suspend. This is a problem with the driver and not the device itself.
If the device has a power switch, try turning it off and then on again. In most cases, the device will start working again. If it connects via a USB cable or similar, unplug the device and then plug it in again and see if it works.
If you cannot turn off or unplug the device, or if this does not work, you may need to restart your computer for the device to start working again.
Suspend sends your computer to sleep so it uses less power.
What happens when I suspend my computer?
When you suspend the computer, you send it to sleep. All of your applications and documents remain open, but the screen and other parts of the computer switch off to save power. The computer is still switched on though, and it will still be using a small amount of power. You can wake it up by pressing a key or clicking the mouse. If that does not work, try pressing the power button.
Some computers have problems with hardware support which mean that they may not be able to suspend properly. It is a good idea to test suspend on your computer to see if it does work before relying on it.
Always save your work before suspending
You should save all of your work before suspending the computer, just in case something goes wrong and your open applications and documents cannot be recovered when you resume the computer again.
The screen will dim when the computer is idle in order to save power.
Why does my screen go dim after a while?
If it is possible to set the brightness of your screen, it will dim when the computer is idle in order to save power. When you start using the computer again, the screen will brighten.
To stop the screen from dimming itself:
Click Power in the sidebar to open the panel.
Switch the Dim screen when inactive switch to off in the Power Saving section.
Loose cables and hardware problems are possible reasons.
My computer will not turn on
There are a number of reasons why your computer will not turn on. This topic gives a brief overview of some of the possible reasons.
Computer not plugged in, empty battery, or loose cable
Make sure that the power cables of the computer are firmly plugged in and the power outlets are switched on. Make sure that the monitor is plugged in and switched on too. If you have a laptop, connect the charging cable (in case it has run out of battery). You may also want to check that the battery is correctly fitted in place (check the underside of the laptop) if it is removable.
Problem with the computer hardware
A component of your computer may be broken or malfunctioning. If this is the case, you will need to get your computer repaired. Common faults include a broken power supply unit, incorrectly-fitted components (such as the memory or RAM) and a faulty motherboard.
The computer beeps and then switches off
If the computer beeps several times when you turn it on and then turns off (or fails to start), it may be indicating that it has detected a problem. These beeps are sometimes referred to as beep codes, and the pattern of beeps is intended to tell you what the problem with the computer is. Different manufacturers use different beep codes, so you will have to consult the manual for your computer’s motherboard, or take your computer in for repairs.
The computer fans are spinning but nothing is on the screen
The first thing to check is that your monitor is plugged in and turned on.
This problem could also be due to a hardware fault. The fans might turn on when you press the power button, but other essential parts of the computer might fail to turn on. In this case, take your computer in for repairs.
Bluetooth, wi-fi and mobile broadband can be switched off to reduce battery use.
Switch off unused wireless technologies
You can reduce battery use by switching off bluetooth, wi-fi or mobile broadband when they are not in use.
The Power Saving section contains switches for Wi-Fi, Mobile broadband, and Bluetooth. Switch the unused services to off. Re-enable when needed by switching to on.

How to print a folded, multi-page booklet using A4 or Letter-sized paper.
Print a booklet
You can print a booklet from a PDF.
If the number of pages in your PDF document is not a multiple of 4, you should add the appropriate number of blank pages (1,2 or 3) to make it a multiple of 4. To do so, you can:
Create a LibreOffice document with the number (1-3) of blank pages needed.
Export the blank pages to a PDF by choosing File Export as PDF….
Merge the blank pages with your PDF document using PDF-Shuffler or PDF Mod, placing the blank pages at the end.

Cancel a pending print job and remove it from the queue.
Cancel, pause or release a print job
You can cancel a pending print job and remove it from the queue in the printer settings.
Cancel a print job
If you accidentally started printing a document, you can cancel the print so that you do not need to waste any ink or paper.
How to cancel a print job:
Open the Activities overview and start typing Printers.
Click Printers to open the panel.
Click the Show Jobs button on the right-hand side of the Printers dialog.
Cancel the print job by clicking the stop button.
If this does not cancel the print job like you expected, try holding down the cancel button on your printer.
As a last resort, especially if you have a big print job with a lot of pages that will not cancel, remove the paper from the printer’s paper input tray. The printer should realize that there is no paper and will stop printing. You can then try canceling the print job again, or try turning the printer off and then on again.
Be careful that you don’t damage the printer when removing the paper, though. If you would have to pull hard on the paper to remove it, you should probably just leave it where it is.
Pause and release a print job
If you want to pause or release a print job, you can do so by going to the jobs dialog in the printer settings and click the appropriate button.
Click the Show Jobs button on the right-hand side of the Printers dialog and either pause or release the print job based on your needs.
Print a document on a different paper size or orientation.
Change the paper size when printing
If you want to change the paper size of your document (for example, print a US Letter-sized PDF on A4 paper), you can change the printing format for the document.
Select the Page Setup tab.
Under the Paper column, choose your Paper size from the drop-down list.
Click Print to print your document.
You can also use the Orientation drop-down list to choose a different orientation:
Portrait

Make sure that you have the envelope the right way up, and have chosen the correct paper size.
Print envelopes
Most printers will allow you to print directly onto an envelope. This is especially useful if you have a lot of letters to send, for example.
Printing onto envelopes
There are two things you need to check when trying to print onto an envelope.
The first is that your printer knows what size the envelope is. Press CtrlP to open the Print dialog, go to the Page Setup tab and choose the Paper type as “Envelope” if you can. If you cannot do this, see if you can change the Paper size to an envelope size (for example, C5). The pack of envelopes will say what size they are; most envelopes come in standard sizes.
Secondly, you need to make sure that the envelopes are loaded with the right side up in the printer’s in-tray. Check the printer’s manual for this, or try to print a single envelope and check which side is printed on to see which way is the right way up.
Some printers are not designed to be able to print envelopes, especially some laser printers. Check your printer’s manual to see if it accepts envelopes. Otherwise, you could damage the printer by feeding an envelope in.
Check the amount of ink or toner left in printer cartridges.
How can I check my printer’s ink or toner levels?
How you check how much ink or toner is left in your printer depends on the model and manufacturer of your printer, and the drivers and applications installed on your computer.
Some printers have a built-in screen to display ink levels and other information.
Some printers report toner or ink levels to the computer, which can be found in the Printers panel in Settings. The ink level will be shown with the printer details if it is available.
The drivers and status tools for most HP printers are provided by the HP Linux Imaging and Printing (HPLIP) project. Other manufacturers might supply proprietary drivers with similar features.
Alternatively, you can install an application to check or monitor ink levels. Inkblot shows ink status for many HP, Epson and Canon printers. See if your printer is on the list of supported models. Another ink levels application for Epson and some other printers is mtink.
Some printers are not yet well supported on Linux, and others are not designed to report their ink levels.
Change the name or location of a printer in the printer settings.
Change the name or location of a printer

Press Unlock in the top right corner and type in your password when prompted.
Click the name of your printer, and start typing a new name for the printer.
Press Enter to save your changes.
Change printer location
To change the location of your printer:
Click the location, and start editing the location.
Press Enter to save the changes.
Collate and reverse the print order.
Make pages print in a different order
Reverse
Printers usually print the first page first, and the last page last, so the pages end up in reverse order when you pick them up. If needed, you can reverse this printing order.
To reverse the order:
Press CtrlP to open the Print dialog.
In the General tab, under Copies, check Reverse. The last page will be printed first, and so on.
Collate
If you are printing more than one copy of the document, the print-outs will be grouped by page number by default (that is, all of the copies of page one come out, then the copies of page two, and so on). Collating will make each copy come out with its pages grouped together in the right order instead.
To collate:
In the General tab, under Copies, check Collate.
How you clear a paper jam will depend on the make and model of printer that you have.
Clearing a paper jam
Sometimes printers incorrectly feed sheets of paper and get jammed.
The manual for your printer will usually provide detailed instructions on how to clear paper jams. Usually, you will need to open one of the printer’s panels to find the jam inside and then firmly (but carefully!) pull the jammed paper out of the printer’s feeding mechanism.
Once the jam has been cleared you may need to press the printer’s resume button to start printing again. With some printers, you may even need to turn the printer off and then on again, and then start the print job again.
Print only specific pages, or only a range of pages.
Print only certain pages
To only print certain pages from the document:
In the General tab, choose Pages from the Range section.
Type the numbers of the pages you want to print in the text box, separated by commas. Use a dash to denote a range of pages.
For example, if you enter “1,3,5-7,9” in the Pages text box, pages 1,3,5,6,7 and 9 will be printed.

Pick the printer that you use most often.
Set the default printer
If you have more than one printer available, you can select which will be your default printer. You may want to pick the printer you use most often.
You need administrative privileges on the system to set the default printer.
Click Printers.
Select your desired default printer from the list of available printers.
Select the Default printer checkbox.
When you print in an application, the default printer is automatically used, unless you choose a different printer.
Set up a printer that is connected to your computer, or your local network.
Set up a local printer
Your system can recognize many types of printers automatically once they are connected. Most printers are connected with a USB cable that attaches to your computer, but some printers connect to your wired or wireless network.
If your printer is connected to the network, it will not be set up automatically – you should add it from the Printers panel in Settings.
Make sure the printer is turned on.
Connect the printer to your system via the appropriate cable. You may see activity on the screen as the system searches for drivers, and you may be asked to authenticate to install them.
A message will appear when the system is finished installing the printer. Select Print Test Page to print a test page, or Options to make additional changes in the printer setup.
If your printer was not set up automatically, you can add it in the printer settings:
Press the Add… button.
In the pop-up window, select your new printer and press Add.
If your printer is not discovered automatically, but you know its network address, enter it into the text field at the bottom of the dialog and then press Add
If your printer does not appear in the Add Printer window, you may need to install print drivers.
After you install the printer, you may wish to change your default printer.
If print-outs are streaky, fading, or missing colors, check your ink levels or clean the print head.
Why are there streaks, lines or the wrong colors on my print-outs?
If your print-outs are streaky, faded, have lines on them that should not be there, or are otherwise poor in quality, this may be due to a problem with the printer or a low ink or toner supply.
Fading text or images
You may be running out of ink or toner. Check your ink or toner supply and buy a new cartridge if necessary.
Streaks and lines
If you have an inkjet printer, the print head may be dirty or partially blocked. Try cleaning the print head. See the printer’s manual for instructions.
Wrong colors
The printer may have run out of one color of ink or toner. Check your ink or toner supply and buy a new cartridge if necessary.
Jagged lines, or lines are not straight
If lines on your print-out that should be straight turn out jagged, you may need to align the print head. See the printer’s instruction manual for details on how to do this.
Save a document as a PDF, PostScript or SVG file instead of sending it to a printer.
Print to file
You can choose to print a document to a file instead of sending it to print from a printer. Printing to file will create a PDF, a PostScript or a SVG file that contains the document. This can be useful if you want to transfer the document to another machine or to share it with someone.
To print to file:
Select Print to File under Printer in the General tab.
To change the default filename and where the file is saved to, click the filename below the printer selection. Click Select once you have finished choosing.
PDF is the default file type for the document. If you want to use a different Output format, select either PostScript or SVG.

Prevent other people from using your desktop when you go away from your computer.
Automatically lock your screen
When you leave your computer, you should lock the screen to prevent other people from using your desktop and accessing your files. If you sometimes forget to lock your screen, you may wish to have your computer’s screen lock automatically after a set period of time. This will help to secure your computer when you aren’t using it.

To set the length of time before your screen locks automatically:
Select Screen Lock.
Make sure Automatic Screen Lock is switched on, then select a length of time from the drop-down list.
Applications can present notifications to you that are still displayed on your lock screen. This is convenient, for example, to see if you have any email without unlocking your screen. If you’re concerned about other people seeing these notifications, switch Show Notifications off.
When your screen is locked, and you want to unlock it, press Esc, or swipe up from the bottom of the screen with your mouse. Then enter your password, and press Enter or click Unlock. Alternatively, just start typing your password and the lock curtain will be automatically raised as you type.

ShiftPrt Scrn to take a screenshot of an area you select.
When you use a keyboard shortcut, the image is automatically saved in your Pictures folder in your home folder with a file name that begins with Screenshot and includes the date and time it was taken.
If you do not have a Pictures folder, the images will be saved in your home folder instead.
You can also hold down Ctrl with any of the above shortcuts to copy the screenshot image to the clipboard instead of saving it.
Make a screencast
You can make a video recording of what is happening on your screen:
Press CtrlAltShiftR to start recording what is on your screen.
A red circle is displayed in the top right corner of the screen when the recording is in progress.
Once you have finished, press CtrlAltShiftR again to stop the recording.
The video is automatically saved in your Videos folder in your home folder, with a file name that starts with Screencast and includes the date and time it was taken.
If you do not have a Videos folder, the videos will be saved in your home folder instead.
You can log in to your system using a supported fingerprint scanner instead of typing in your password.
Log in with a fingerprint
If your system has a supported fingerprint scanner, you can record your fingerprint and use it to log in.
Record a fingerprint
Before you can log in with your fingerprint, you need to record it so that the system can use it to identify you.
If your finger is too dry, you may have difficulty registering your fingerprint. If this happens, moisten your finger slightly, dry it with a clean, lint-free cloth, and retry.
You need administrator privileges to edit user accounts other than your own.
Open the Activities overview and start typing Users.
Click on Users to open the panel.

Some translations may be incomplete, and certain applications may not support your language at all. Any untranslated text will appear in the language in which the software was originally developed, usually American English.
There are some special folders in your home folder where applications can store things like music, pictures, and documents. These folders use standard names according to your language. When you log back in, you will be asked if you want to rename these folders to the standard names for your selected language. If you plan to use the new language all the time, you should update the folder names.
Change how long to wait before locking the screen in the Privacy settings.
The screen locks itself too quickly
If you leave your computer for a few minutes, the screen will automatically lock itself so you have to enter your password to start using it again. This is done for security reasons (so no one can mess with your work if you leave the computer unattended), but it can be annoying if the screen locks itself too quickly.
To wait a longer period before the screen is automatically locked:
Click on Privacy in the sidebar to open the panel.
Press on Screen Lock.
If Automatic Screen Lock is on, you can change the value in the Lock screen after blank for drop-down list.
If you don’t ever want the screen to lock itself automatically, switch the Automatic Screen Lock switch to off.

Learn how to leave your user account, by logging out, switching users, and so on.
Log out, power off or switch users
When you have finished using your computer, you can turn it off, suspend it (to save power), or leave it powered on and log out.
Log out or switch users
To let other users use your computer, you can either log out, or leave yourself logged in and just switch users. If you switch users, all of your applications will continue running, and everything will be where you left it when you log back in.
To Log Out or Switch User, click the system menu on the right side of the top bar, click your name and then choose the correct option.
The Log Out and Switch User entries only appear in the menu if you have more than one user account on your system.
The Switch User entry only appears in the menu if you have more than one user account on your system.
Lock the screen
If you’re leaving your computer for a short time, you should lock your screen to prevent other people from accessing your files or running applications. When you return, raise the lock screen curtain and enter your password to log back in. If you don’t lock your screen, it will lock automatically after a certain amount of time.
To lock your screen, click the system menu on the right side of the top bar and press the lock screen button at the bottom of the menu.
When your screen is locked, other users can log in to their own accounts by clicking Log in as another user on the password screen. You can switch back to your desktop when they are finished.
Suspend
To save power, suspend your computer when you are not using it. If you use a laptop, GNOME, by default, suspends your computer automatically when you close the lid. This saves your state to your computer’s memory and powers off most of the computer’s functions. A very small amount of power is still used during suspend.
To suspend your computer manually, click the system menu on the right side of the top bar. From there you may either hold down the Alt key and click the power off button, or simply long-click the power off button.
Power off or restart
If you want to power off your computer entirely, or do a full restart, click the system menu on the right side of the top bar and press the power off button at the bottom of the menu. A dialog will open offering you the options to either Restart or Power Off.
If there are other users logged in, you may not be allowed to power off or restart the computer because this will end their sessions. If you are an administrative user, you may be asked for your password to power off.
You may want to power off your computer if you wish to move it and do not have a battery, if your battery is low or does not hold charge well. A powered off computer also uses less energy than one which is suspended.

The decorative and functional lock screen conveys useful information.
The lock screen
The lock screen means that you can see what is happening while your computer is locked, and it allows you to get a summary of what has been happening while you have been away. The lock screen curtain shows an attractive image on the screen while your computer is locked, and provides useful information:
the name of the logged-in user
date and time, and certain notifications
battery and network status
To unlock your computer, raise the lock screen curtain by dragging it upward with the cursor, or by pressing Esc or Enter. This will reveal the login screen, where you can enter your password to unlock. Alternatively, just start typing your password and the curtain will be automatically raised as you type. You can also switch users if your computer is configured for more than one.
To hide notifications from the lock screen, see .

Messages drop down from the top of the screen telling you when certain events happen.
Notifications and the notification list
What is a notification?
If an application or a system component wants to get your attention, a notification will be shown at the top of the screen, or on your lock screen.
For example, if you get a new chat message or a new email, you will get a notification informing you. Chat notifications are given special treatment, and are represented by the individual contacts who sent you the chat messages.
Other notifications have selectable option buttons. To close one of these notifications without selecting one of its options, click the close button.
Clicking the close button on some notifications dismisses them. Others, like Rhythmbox or your chat application, will stay hidden in the notification list.
The notification list
The notification list gives you a way to get back to your notifications when it is convenient for you. It appears when you click on the clock, or press SuperV. The notification list contains all the notifications that you have not acted upon or that permanently reside in it.
You can view a notification by clicking on it in the list. You can close the notification list by pressing SuperV again or Esc.
Click the Clear List button to empty the list of notifications.
Hiding notifications
If you are working on something and do not want to be bothered, you can switch off notifications.
Click on Notifications in the sidebar to open the panel.
Switch Notification Popups to off.
When switched off, most notifications will not pop up at the top of the screen. Notifications will still be available in the notification list when you display it (by clicking on the clock, or by pressing SuperV), and they will start popping up again when you switch the switch back to on.
You can also disable or re-enable notifications for individual applications from the Notifications panel.
Hiding lock screen notifications
When your screen is locked, notifications appear on the lock screen. You can configure the lock screen to hide these notifications for privacy reasons.
To switch off notifications when your screen is locked:
Switch Lock Screen Notifications to off.

Workspaces refer to the grouping of windows on your desktop. You can create multiple workspaces, which act like virtual desktops. Workspaces are meant to reduce clutter and make the desktop easier to navigate.
Workspaces refer to the grouping of windows on your desktop. You can use multiple workspaces, which act like virtual desktops. Workspaces are meant to reduce clutter and make the desktop easier to navigate.
Workspaces can be used to organize your work. For example, you could have all your communication windows, such as e-mail and your chat program, on one workspace, and the work you are doing on a different workspace. Your music manager could be on a third workspace.
Using workspaces:
In the Activities overview, move your cursor to the right-most side of the screen.
Press the Super key to open the Activities overview and then move your cursor to the right-most side of the screen.

Your computer will play a simple alert sound for certain types of messages and events. You can choose different sound clips for alerts, set the alert volume independently of your system volume, or disable alert sounds entirely.
Open the Activities overview and start typing Sound.
Click on Sound to open the panel.
In the Alert Sound section, select an alert sound. Each sound will play when you click on it so you can hear how it sounds.
Use the volume slider for System Soundsin the Volume Levels section to set the volume of the alert sound. This will not affect the volume of your music, movies, or other sound files.
Troubleshoot problems like having no sound or having poor sound quality.
Sound problems
There are a number of ways for sound playback to break on your computer. Which of the topics below best describes the problem you are experiencing?
Check your audio cables and sound card drivers.
I hear crackling or buzzing when sounds are playing
If you hear crackling or buzzing when sounds are playing on your computer, you may have a problem with the audio cables or connectors, or a problem with the drivers for the sound card.
Check that the speakers are plugged in correctly.
If the speakers are not fully plugged in, or if they are plugged into the wrong socket, you might hear a buzzing sound.
Make sure the speaker/headphone cable is not damaged.
Audio cables and connectors can gradually wear with use. Try plugging the cable or headphones into another audio device (like an MP3 player or a CD player) to check if there is still a crackling sound. If there is, you may need to replace the cable or headphones.
Check if the sound drivers are not very good.
Some sound cards do not work very well on Linux because they do not have very good drivers. This problem is more difficult to identify. Try searching for the make and model of your sound card on the internet, plus the search term “Linux”, to see if other people are having the same problem.
You can use the lspci command to get more information about your sound card.
Check that the sound is not muted, that cables are plugged in properly, and that the sound card is detected.
I cannot hear any sounds on the computer
If you cannot hear any sounds on your computer, for example when you try to play music, go through the following troubleshooting tips.
Make sure that the sound is not muted
Open the system menu and make sure that the sound is not muted or turned down.
Some laptops have mute switches or keys on their keyboards — try pressing that key to see if it unmutes the sound.
You should also check that you have not muted the application that you are using to play sound (for example, your music player or movie player). The application may have a mute or volume button in its main window, so check that.
Also, you can check the Applications tab in the Sound GUI:
Under Volume Levels, check that your application is not muted.
Check that the speakers are turned on and connected properly
If your computer has external speakers, make sure that they are turned on and that the volume is turned up. Make sure that the speaker cable is securely plugged into the “output” audio socket on your computer. This socket is usually light green in color.
Some sound cards can switch between the socket they use for output (to the speakers) and the socket for input (from a microphone, for instance). The output socket may be different when running Linux, Windows or Mac OS. Try connecting the speaker cable to a different audio socket on your computer.
A final thing to check is that the audio cable is securely plugged into the back of the speakers. Some speakers have more than one input, too.
Check that the correct sound device is selected
Some computers have multiple “sound devices” installed. Some of these are capable of outputting sound and some are not, so you should check that you have the correct sound device selected. This might involve some trial-and-error to choose the right one.
Under Output, change the Profile settings for the selected device and play a sound to see if it works. You might need to go through the list and try each profile.
If that does not work, you might want to try doing the same for any other devices that are listed.
Check that the sound card was detected properly
Your sound card may not have been detected properly probably because the drivers for the card are not installed. You may need to install the drivers for the card manually. How you do this depends on the type of the card.
Run the lspci command in the Terminal to find out what sound card you have:
Go to the Activities overview and open a Terminal.
Run lspci as superuser; either type sudo lspci and type your password, or type su, enter the root (administrative) password, then type lspci.
Check if an audio controller or audio device is listed: in such case you should see the make and model number of the sound card. Also, lspci -v shows a list with more detailed information.
You may be able to find and install drivers for your card. It is best to ask on support forums (or otherwise) for your Linux distribution for instructions.
If you cannot get drivers for your sound card, you might prefer to buy a new sound card. You can get sound cards that can be installed inside the computer and external USB sound cards.
Use an analog or USB microphone and select a default input device.
Use a different microphone
You can use an external microphone for chatting with friends, speaking with colleagues at work, making voice recordings, or using other multimedia applications. Even if your computer has a built-in microphone or a webcam with a microphone, a separate microphone usually provides better audio quality.
If your microphone has a circular plug, just plug it into the appropriate audio socket on your computer. Most computers have two sockets: one for microphones and one for speakers. This socket is usually light red in color or is accompanied by a picture of a microphone. Microphones plugged into the appropriate socket are usually used by default. If not, see the instructions below for selecting a default input device.
If you have a USB microphone, plug it into any USB port on your computer. USB microphones act as separate audio devices, and you may have to specify which microphone to use by default.
Select a default audio input device
In the Input tab, select the device that you want to use. The input level indicator should respond when you speak.
You can adjust the volume and switch the microphone off from this panel.
Connect speakers or headphones and select a default audio output device.
Use different speakers or headphones
You can use external speakers or headphones with your computer. Speakers usually either connect using a circular TRS (tip, ring, sleeve) plug or a USB.
If your speakers or headphones have a TRS plug, plug it into the appropriate socket on your computer. Most computers have two sockets: one for microphones and one for speakers. This socket is usually light green in color or is accompanied by a picture of headphones. Speakers or headphones plugged into a TRS socket are usually used by default. If not, see the instructions below for selecting the default device.
Some computers support multi-channel output for surround sound. This usually uses multiple TRS jacks, which are often color-coded. If you are unsure which plugs go in which sockets, you can test the sound output in the sound settings.
If you have USB speakers or headphones, or analog headphones plugged into a USB sound card, plug them into any USB port. USB speakers act as separate audio devices, and you may have to specify which speakers to use by default.
In the Output tab, select the device that you want to use.
Use the Test Speakers button to check that all speakers are working and are connected to the correct socket.
Set the sound volume for the computer and control the loudness of each application.
Change the sound volume
To change the sound volume, open the system menu from the right side of the top bar and move the volume slider left or right. You can completely turn off sound by dragging the slider to the left.
Some keyboards have keys that let you control the volume. They normally look like stylized speakers with waves coming out of them. They are often near the “F” keys at the top. On laptop keyboards, they are usually on the “F” keys. Hold down the Fn key on your keyboard to use them.
If you have external speakers, you can also change the volume using the speakers’ volume control. Some headphones have a volume control too.
Changing the sound volume for individual applications
You can change the volume for one application and leave the volume for others unchanged. This is useful if you are listening to music and browsing the web, for example. You might want to turn off the audio in the web browser so sounds from websites do not interrupt the music.
Some applications have volume controls in their main windows. If your application has its volume control, use that to change the volume. If not:
Under Volume Levels, change the volume of the application listed there.
Only applications that are playing sounds are listed. If an application is playing sounds but is not listed, it might not support the feature that lets you control its volume in this way. In such case, you cannot change its volume.

Type characters not found on your keyboard, including foreign alphabets, mathematical symbols, and dingbats.
Enter special characters
You can enter and view thousands of characters from most of the world’s writing systems, even those not found on your keyboard. This page lists some different ways you can enter special characters.
Methods to enter characters
Characters
GNOME comes with a character map application that allows you to find and insert unusual characters, including emoji, by browsing character categories or searching for keywords.
You can launch Characters from the Activities overview.
Compose key
A compose key is a special key that allows you to press multiple keys in a row to get a special character. For example, to type the accented letter é, you can press compose then ' then e.
Keyboards don’t have specific compose keys. Instead, you can define one of the existing keys on your keyboard as a compose key.
Define a compose key
Click the Keyboard amp; Mouse tab.
Click Disabled next to the Compose Key setting.
Turn the switch on in the dialog and pick the keyboard shortcut you want to use.
Tick the checkbox of the key that you want to set as the Compose key.
Close the dialog.
You can type many common characters using the compose key, for example:
Press compose then ' then a letter to place an acute accent over that letter, such as é.
Press compose then ` (back tick) then a letter to place a grave accent over that letter, such as è.
Press compose then " then a letter to place an umlaut over that letter, such as ë.
Press compose then - then a letter to place a macron over that letter, such as ē.
For more compose key sequences, see the compose key page on Wikipedia.
Code points
You can enter any Unicode character using only your keyboard with the numeric code point of the character. Every character is identified by a four-character code point. To find the code point for a character, look it up in the Characters application. The code point is the four characters after U+.
To enter a character by its code point, press CtrlShiftU, then type the four-character code and press Space or Enter. If you often use characters that you can’t easily access with other methods, you might find it useful to memorize the code point for those characters so you can enter them quickly.
Keyboard layouts
You can make your keyboard behave like the keyboard for another language, regardless of the letters printed on the keys. You can even easily switch between different keyboard layouts using an icon in the top bar. To learn how, see .
Input methods
An Input Method expands the previous methods by allowing to enter characters not only with keyboard but also any input devices. For instance you could enter characters with a mouse using a gesture method, or enter Japanese characters using a Latin keyboard.
To choose an input method, right-click over a text widget, and in the menu Input Method, choose an input method you want to use. There is no default input method provided, so refer to the input methods documentation to see how to use them.

Add a new user account
You can add multiple user accounts to your computer. Give one account to each person in your household or company. Every user has their own home folder, documents, and settings.
You need administrator privileges to add user accounts.
Press the + button, below the list of accounts on the left, to add a new user account.
If you want the new user to have administrative access to the computer, select Administrator for the account type.
Administrators can do things like add and delete users, install software and drivers, and change the date and time.
Enter the new user’s full name. The username will be filled in automatically based on the full name. If you do not like the proposed username, you can change it.
You can choose to set a password for the new user, or let them set it themselves on their first login.
generate password
If you choose to set the password now, you can press the  icon to automatically generate a random password.
If you want to change the password after creating the account, select the account, Unlock the panel and press the current password status.
In the Users panel, you can click the image next to the user’s name to the right to set an image for the account. This image will be shown in the login window. GNOME provides some stock photos you can use, or you can select your own or take a picture with your webcam.
You can allow users to make changes to the system by giving them administrative privileges.
Change who has administrative privileges
Administrative privileges are a way of deciding who can make changes to important parts of the system. You can change which users have administrative privileges and which ones do not. They are a good way of keeping your system secure and preventing potentially damaging unauthorized changes.
You need administrator privileges to change account types.
Click Users to open the panel.
Select the user whose privileges you want to change.
Click the label Standard next to Account Type and select Administrator.
The user’s privileges will be changed when they next log in.
The first user account on the system is usually the one that has administrator privileges. This is the user account that was created when you first installed the system.
It is unwise to have too many users with Administrator privileges on one system.
You need administrative privileges to change important parts of your system.
How do administrative privileges work?
As well as the files that you create, your computer has a number of files which are needed by the system for it to work properly. If these important system files are changed incorrectly they can cause various things to break, so they are protected from changes by default. Certain applications also modify important parts of the system, and so are also protected.
The way that they are protected is by only allowing users with administrative privileges to change the files or use the applications. In day-to-day use, you will not need to change any system files or use these applications, so by default you do not have administrative privileges.
Sometimes you need to use these applications, so you may be able to temporarily get administrative privileges to allow you to make the changes. If an application needs administrative privileges, it will ask for your password. For example, if you want to install some new software, the software installer (package manager) will ask for your administrator password so it can add the new application to the system. Once it has finished, your administrative privileges will be taken away again.
Administrative privileges are associated with your user account. Administrator users are allowed to have these privileges while Standard users are not. Without administrative privileges you will not be able to install software. Some user accounts (for example, the “root” account) have permanent administrative privileges. You should not use administrative privileges all of the time, because you might accidentally change something you did not intend to (like delete a needed system file, for example).
In summary, administrative privileges allow you to change important parts of your system when needed, but prevent you from doing it accidentally.
What does “super user” mean?
A user with administrative privileges is sometimes called a super user. This is simply because that user has more privileges than normal users. You might see people discussing things like su and sudo; these are programs for temporarily giving you “super user” (administrative) privileges.
Why are administrative privileges useful?
Requiring users to have administrative privileges before important system changes are made is useful because it helps to prevent your system from being broken, intentionally or unintentionally.
If you had administrative privileges all of the time, you might accidentally change an important file, or run an application which changes something important by mistake. Only getting administrative privileges temporarily, when you need them, reduces the risk of these mistakes happening.
Only certain trusted users should be allowed to have administrative privileges. This prevents other users from messing with the computer and doing things like uninstalling applications that you need, installing applications that you don’t want, or changing important files. This is useful from a security standpoint.
You can do some things, like installing applications, only if you have administrative privileges.
Problems caused by administrative restrictions
You may experience a few problems if you do not have administrative privileges. Some tasks require administrative privileges in order to work, such as:
connecting to networks or wireless networks,
viewing the contents of a different disk partition (for example, a Windows partition), or
installing new applications.
You can change who has administrative privileges.
Set up automatic login for when you switch on your computer.
Log in automatically
You can change your settings so that you are automatically logged in to your account when you start up your computer:
Select the user account that you want to log in to automatically at startup.
Switch the Automatic Login switch to on.
When you next start up your computer, you will be logged in automatically. If you have this option enabled, you will not need to type in your password to log in to your account which means that if someone else starts up your computer, they will be able to access your account and your personal data including your files and browser history.
If your account type is Standard, you cannot change this setting. Contact your system administrator who can change this setting for you.
Keep your account secure by changing your password often in your account settings.
Change your password
It is a good idea to change your password from time to time, especially if you think someone else knows your password.
Click the label ····· next to Password. If you are changing the password for a different user, you will first need to Unlock the panel.
Enter your current password, then a new password. Enter your new password again in the Verify New Password field.
You can press the  icon to automatically generate a random password.

Use longer, more complicated passwords.
Choose a secure password
Make your passwords easy enough for you to remember, but very difficult for others (including computer programs) to guess.
Choosing a good password will help to keep your computer safe. If your password is easy to guess, someone may figure it out and gain access to your personal information.
People could even use computers to systematically try to guess your password, so even one that would be difficult for a human to guess might be extremely easy for a computer program to crack. Here are some tips for choosing a good password:
Use a mixture of upper-case and lower-case letters, numbers, symbols and spaces in the password. This makes it more difficult to guess; there are more symbols from which to choose, meaning more possible passwords that someone would have to check when trying to guess yours.
A good method for choosing a password is to take the first letter of each word in a phrase that you can remember. The phrase could be the name of a movie, a book, a song or an album. For example, “Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions” would become F:ARoMD or faromd or f: aromd.
Make your password as long as possible. The more characters it contains, the longer it should take for a person or computer to guess it.
Do not use any words that appear in a standard dictionary in any language. Password crackers will try these first. The most common password is “password” — people can guess passwords like this very quickly!
Do not use any personal information such as a date, license plate number, or any family member’s name.
Do not use any nouns.
Choose a password that can be typed quickly, to decrease the chances of someone being able to make out what you have typed if they happen to be watching you.
Never write your passwords down anywhere. They can be easily found!
Use different passwords for different things.
Use different passwords for different accounts.
If you use the same password for all of your accounts, anyone who guesses it will be able to access all of your accounts immediately.
It can be difficult to remember lots of passwords, however. Though not as secure as using a different passwords for everything, it may be easier to use the same one for things that do not matter (like websites), and different ones for important things (like your online banking account and your email).
Change your passwords regularly.
You might not have the right codecs installed, or the DVD might be the wrong region.
Why won’t DVDs play?
If you insert a DVD into your computer and it doesn’t play, you may not have the right DVD codecs installed, or the DVD might be from a different region.
Installing the right codecs for DVD playback
In order to play DVDs, you need to have the right codecs installed. A codec is a piece of software that allows applications to read a video or audio format. If your movie player software doesn’t find the right codecs, it may offer to install them for you. If not, you’ll have to install the codecs manually — ask for help on how to do this, for example on your Linux distribution’s support forums.
DVDs are also copy-protected using a system called CSS. This prevents you from copying DVDs, but it also prevents you from playing them unless you have extra software to handle the copy protection. This software is available from a number of Linux distributions, but cannot be legally used in all countries. You can buy a commercial DVD decoder that can handle copy protection from Fluendo. It works with Linux and should be legal to use in all countries.
Checking the DVD region
DVDs have a region code, which tells you in which region of the world they are allowed to be played. If the region of your computer’s DVD player does not match the region of the DVD you are trying to play, you won’t be able to play the DVD. For example, if you have a Region 1 DVD player, you will only be allowed to play DVDs from North America.
It is often possible to change the region used by your DVD player, but it can only be done a few times before it locks into one region permanently. To change the DVD region of your computer’s DVD player, use regionset.
You can find more information about DVD region codes on Wikipedia.
Check that they have the right video codecs installed.
Other people can’t play the videos I made
If you made a video on your Linux computer and sent it to someone using Windows or Mac OS, you may find that they have problems playing the video.
To be able to play your video, the person you sent it to must have the right codecs installed. A codec is a little piece of software that knows how to take the video and display it on the screen. There are lots of different video formats and each requires a different codec to play it back. You can check which format your video is by doing:
Open Files from the Activities overview.
Right-click on the video file and select Properties.
Go to the Audio/Video or Video tab and look at which Codec are listed under Video and Audio (if the video also has audio).
Ask the person having problems with playback if they have the right codec installed. They may find it helpful to search the web for the name of the codec plus the name of their video playback application. For example, if your video uses the Theora format and you have a friend using Windows Media Player to try and watch it, search for “theora windows media player”. You will often be able to download the right codec for free if it’s not installed.
If you can’t find the right codec, try the VLC media player. It works on Windows and Mac OS as well as Linux, and supports a lot of different video formats. Failing that, try converting your video into a different format. Most video editors are able to do this, and specific video converter applications are available. Check the software installer application to see what’s available.
There are a few other problems which might prevent someone from playing your video. The video could have been damaged when you sent it to them (sometimes big files aren’t copied across perfectly), they could have problems with their video playback application, or the video may not have been created properly (there could have been some errors when you saved the video).
Switch the Wacom tablet to Left-Handed Orientation.
Use the tablet left-handed
Some tablets have hardware buttons on one side. The tablet can be rotated 180 degrees to position these buttons for left-handed people. To switch the orientation to left-handed:
Open the Activities overview and start typing Wacom Tablet.
Click on Wacom Tablet to open the panel.
Click the Tablet button in the header bar.
If no tablet is detected, you’ll be asked to Please plug in or turn on your Wacom tablet. Click the Bluetooth Settings link to connect a wireless tablet.
Switch the Left-Handed Orientation switch to on.
Switch the tablet between tablet mode and mouse mode.
Set the Wacom tablet’s tracking mode
Tracking Mode determines how the pointer is mapped to the screen.
Next to Tracking Mode, select Tablet (absolute) or Touchpad (relative).
In absolute mode, each point on the tablet maps to a point on the screen. The top left corner of the screen, for instance, always corresponds to the same point on the tablet.
In relative mode, if you lift the pointer off the tablet and put it down in a different position, the cursor on the screen doesn’t move. This is the way a mouse operates.
Map the Wacom tablet to a specific monitor.
Choose a monitor
Click Map to Monitor…
Check Map to single monitor.
Next to Output, select the monitor you wish to receive input from your graphics tablet.
Only the monitors that are configured will be selectable.
Switch the Keep aspect ratio (letterbox) switch to on to match the drawing area of the tablet to the proportions of the monitor. This setting, also called force proportions, “letterboxes” the drawing area on a tablet to correspond more directly to a display. For example, a 4∶3 tablet would be mapped so that the drawing area would correspond to a widescreen display.
Click Close.
Define the button functions and pressure feel of the Wacom stylus.
Configure the stylus
Click Wacom Tablet in the sidebar to open the panel.
Click the Stylus button in the header bar.
If no stylus is detected, you’ll be asked to Please move your stylus to the proximity of the tablet to configure it.
The panel contains details and settings specific to your stylus, with the device name (the stylus class) and diagram to the left. These settings can be adjusted:
Eraser Pressure Feel: use the slider to adjust the “feel” (how physical pressure is translated to digital values) between Soft and Firm.
Button/Scroll Wheel configuration (these change to reflect the stylus). Click the menu next to each label to select one of these functions: No Action, Left Mouse Button Click, Middle Mouse Button Click, Right Mouse Button Click, Scroll Up, Scroll Down, Scroll Left, Scroll Right, Back, or Forward.
Tip Pressure Feel: use the slider to adjust the “feel” between Soft and Firm.
If you have more than one stylus, use the pager next to the stylus device name to choose which stylus to configure.
Map a monitor, configure the stylus, use the tablet left handed…
