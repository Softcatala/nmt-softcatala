Some screens will be automatically configured depending on your hardware and the type of media you used to start the installation. You can still change the detected settings in any screen. Screens which have not been automatically configured and therefore require your attention before you begin the installation are marked by an exclamation mark. You can not start the actual installation process before you finish configuring these settings.
Consoles and Logging During the Installation
The following sections describe how to access logs and an interactive shell during the installation. This is useful when troubleshooting problems but should not be necessary in most cases.
Accessing Consoles
In general there is no reason to leave the default graphical installation environment unless you need to diagnose an installation problem.

Tethered Camera Control amp; Capture
Entangle is a program used to control digital cameras that are connected to the computer via USB.
Entangle can trigger the camera shutter to capture new images. When supported by the camera a continuously updating preview of the scene can be displayed prior to capture. Images will be downloaded and displayed as they are captured by the camera. Entangle also allows the settings of the camera to be changed from the computer.
Entangle is compatible with most DSLR cameras from Nikon and Canon some of their compact camera models and a variety of cameras from other manufacturers.

In most cases when you boot the PRODUCT; installer from your prepared boot media or server the boot menu will the the first thing that appears. From this menu you can either start the actual installation or you can use the boot media to rescue an existing system.
The way the boot menu will look and function will vary somewhat depending on your system's firmware - BIOS systems use the SYSLINUX boot loader and UEFI systems use GRUB2. However both of the menus described below function very similarly from a user's point of view.
Use arrow keys to select an entry in the menu and Enter to confirm your selection. The first two entries in the list will both proceed with the installation; the first one will start the installer directly and the second one will verify the integrity of the boot media before starting the installation.
The final entry in the list is Troubleshooting; this is a submenu. Selecting this entry and pressing Enter will display a new set of selections where you can choose to install in basic graphics mode (useful if you want to do a manual graphical installation but your system has issues with the default graphical installer) rescue an existing system or test your system's memory modules for errors (on BIOS systems only). The troubleshooting menu also allows you to exit the boot menu and boot normally from your system's hard drive via the Boot from local drive option.
Every menu entry in the list is a predefined set of boot options and these options can be customized to change some aspects of the installer's behavior. To edit the default set of boot options press Tab on BIOS systems or e on UEFI systems. The key to use is also displayed at the bottom of the screen.
The Keyboard Layout screen allows you to set up one or more keyboard layouts for your system and a way to switch between them. One keyboard layout is configured automatically based on your selection in  but you can change this layout and add additional ones before you begin the installation.
The right half of the screen contains a window listing all currently configured layouts. The order in which the layouts are displayed is important - the same order will be used when switching between layouts and the first listed layout will be the default on your system.
The + button adds a new layout. When you press this button a new window opens with a list of all available layouts grouped by language. You can find a layout by browsing the list or you can use the search bar at the bottom of this window. When you find the layout you want to add highlight it and press Add.
The - button removes the currently highlighted layout.
If you use a layout that cannot accept Latin characters such as Russian you are advised to also add the English (United States) layout and configure a keyboard combination to switch between the two layouts. If you only select a layout without Latin characters you may be unable to enter a valid root password and user credentials later in the installation process. This may prevent you from completing the installation.
Once you configure everything required for the installation you can press the Begin Installation button to start installing PRODUCT;. This will take you to . Note that as the text below this button says nothing will be written to your hard drive before you press this button. You can press Quit at any point; this will discard all changes you made in the installer so far and reboot the system.
Welcome Screen
The language you select on this screen will be used during the installation and it will also be used on the installed system by default. You can change the language for the installed system later but once you click Continue on this screen you will not be able to go back and change the language used inside the installer itself.
One language is pre-selected by default on top of the list. If network access is configured at this point (for example if you booted from a network server instead of local media) the pre-selected language will be determined based on automatic location detection using the GeoIP module. Alternatively if you used the inst.lang= option on the boot command line or in your PXE server configuration this language will be selected by default but you will still be able to change it.
After you select your language and locale click Continue to confirm your selection and proceed to .

Back up your database before upgrading.
SHOGUN Machine Learning Toolbox
--extlinux Use extlinux as the boot loader. Note that there is no attempt to check whether this will work for your platform which means your system may be unable to boot after completing the installation if you use this option.
--dnf Use the experimental DNF package management backend to replace the default YUM package manager. See  for more information about the DNF project.

Things outside of our daily plans always come up and sometimes we have to give up on our plan and attend to these more urgent unpredictable issues. Don't worry about it!
At the end of the day jot down anything you may have accomplished or spent time on outside of the scope of the to-dos you planned for the day. Create a fresh To-Do note for tomorrow and copy any items you didn't accomplish today into it for your plan tomorrow. For any items you completed today cross them off your "Master To-Do List" as well.
You can keep all these lists always visible in the Gnote notes list by clicking the little thumbtack icon next to them in the list. Keeping daily to-do lists using Gnote is a great way to review what you've accomplished at the end of the week and makes it easy to write weekly status reports if your job requires that.
2. Clean up those sticky-notes all over your desk!
Tear them all down! That's right! Gather up all your sticky-notes scraps of paper notes written on the back of other papers and make a pile. One-by-one go through each piece of paper and transcribe it into a new digital Gnote. Now your desk is much neater and you can search across all of your notes.

entrycachenowaitpercentage (integer)
The entry cache can be set to automatically update entries in the background if they are requested beyond a percentage of the entrycachetimeout value for the domain.
For example if the domain's entrycachetimeout is set to 30s and entrycachenowaitpercentage is set to 50 (percent) entries that come in after 15 seconds past the last cache update will be returned immediately but the SSSD will go and update the cache on its own so that future requests will not need to block waiting for a cache update.
Valid values for this option are 0-99 and represent a percentage of the entrycachetimeout for each domain. For performance reasons this percentage will never reduce the nowait timeout to less than 10 seconds.  (0 disables this feature)
Default 7 (Kerberos) 0 (LDAP)
idprovider (string)

System Security Services Daemon
sssd  options 
SSSD provides a set of daemons to manage access to remote directories and authentication mechanisms. It provides an NSS and PAM interface toward the system and a pluggable backend system to connect to multiple different account sources as well as D-Bus interface. It is also the basis to provide client auditing and policy services for projects like FreeIPA. It provides a more robust database to store local users as well as extended user data.
-d--debug-level LEVEL
--debug-timestamps=mode
This option forces sssuserdel to remove the user's home directory and mail spool even if they are not owned by the specified user.

GIMP supports gzip compression on the fly. Just add .gz (or .bz2 if you have bzip2 installed) to the filename and your image will be saved compressed. Of course loading compressed images works too.
Pressing and holding the Shift key before making a selection allows you to add to the current selection instead of replacing it. Using Ctrl before making a selection subtracts from the current one.
You can draw simple squares or circles using Edit→Stroke Selection. It strokes the edge of your current selection. More complex shapes can be drawn using the Path tool or with Filters→Render→Gfig.
If you stroke a path (Edit→Stroke Path) the paint tools can be used with their current settings. You can use the Paintbrush in gradient mode or even the Eraser or the Smudge tool.
You can create and edit complex selections using the Path tool. The Paths dialog allows you to work on multiple paths and to convert them to selections.

Tool options
The Tool Options for many tools have new possibilities that weren't available in GIMP 1. Without being exhaustive here are the most noticeable improvements.
All selection tools now have mode buttons Replace Add Subtract and Intersect. In GIMP 1 the only way to change the selection mode was to use the Ctrl or Shift buttons which could get very confusing because those buttons also had other functions. For example pressing and holding the Shift key while using the Rectangle selection tool forces the rectangle to be a square. Thus to add a square selection you would first press Shift then click the mouse then release Shift then press Shift again then sweep out the selection with the mouse then release Shift. It can now be done more easily.
For transformation tools buttons now control which object (layer selection or path) is affected by the transformation. You can for example transform a rectangular selection to various quadrilateral shapes. Path transformation in particular is now easier than it was before.
Fade out and Paint Using Gradient are now available for all drawing tools. In fact all drawing tools now have their own individual brush gradient and pattern settings in contrast to GIMP 1 where there was a single global setting that applied to all drawing tools. Now you can select different brushes for the Pencil and the Paint Brush or different patterns for the Clone and Fill tools. You can change these setting by using your mouse wheel over the relevant resource button (this is most useful for quickly and easily choosing a brush).

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document numbering more than 100 and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts you must enclose the copies in covers that carry clearly and legibly all these Cover Texts Front-Cover Texts on the front cover and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100 you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document free of added material. If you use the latter option you must take reasonably prudent steps when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
It is requested but not required that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

Comparing 2.6 display vs 2.4
Important progress towards high bit-depth and non-destructive editing in GIMP has been made. Most color operations in GIMP are now ported to the powerful graph based image processing framework GEGL  meaning that the internal processing is done in 32bit floating point linear light RGBA. By default the legacy 8bit code paths are still used but a curious user can turn on the use of GEGL for the color operations with Colors / Use GEGL.
Ported many widgets to use the 2D graphics library cairo  for drawing. See this comparison for an example of how much better this looks.

While numerous red-eye workflows exist already GIMP now features a very convenient auto-magic filter to remove red eye from your shots.
Healing Brush
The healing brush is a new tool similar in the working of the clone tool that permits to quickly fix small defects or imperfections due to scratching or dust. In fact the tool is smart enough to being able to understand where and how to modify an image to cure these defects based on image color context.
Here is another clone-like new tool that is able to adapt the destination geometry instead of color as does the healing brush based on preselected distortion settings. As the name suggests perfect when copying images blocks with some type of prospective changes.
A very common problem exposing itself especially when using cheaper lenses is barrel distortion and vignetting. Luckily GIMP provides a brand new filter to compensate for both problems. Saving photographer's pocket is our mission!

Equation for layer mode Overlay
$$E = \frac{I}{255} \times \left(I + \frac{2\times M}{255} \times (255 - I)\right)$$
Example for layer mode Dodge
Dodge mode multiplies the pixel value of the lower layer by 256 then divides that by the inverse of the pixel value of the top layer. The resulting image is usually lighter but some colors may be inverted.
In photography dodging is a technique used in a darkroom to decrease the exposure in particular areas of the image. This brings out details in the shadows. When used for this purpose dodge may work best on Grayscale images and with a painting tool rather than as a layer mode.
Actually both RGB and grayscale images have one additional color channel called the alpha channel which represents opacity. When the alpha value at a given location in a given layer is zero the layer is completely transparent (you can see through it) and the color at that location is determined by what lies underneath. When alpha is maximal (255) the layer is opaque (you cannot see through it) and the color is determined by the color of the layer. Intermediate alpha values correspond to varying degrees of transparency / opacity the color at the location is a proportional mixture of color from the layer and color from underneath.
Example of an image in RGB and Grayscale mode
An image in RGB mode with the channels corresponding to Red Green and Blue.
An image in Grayscale mode with the channel corresponding to Luminosity.
In GIMP every color channel including the alpha channel has a range of possible values from 0 to 255; in computing terminology a depth of 8 bits. Some digital cameras can produce image files with a depth of 16 bits per color channel. GIMP cannot load such a file without losing resolution. In most cases the effects are too subtle to be detected by the human eye but in some cases mainly where there are large areas with slowly varying color gradients the difference may be perceptible.
From System Preferences click on the International icon. In the Language tab the desired language should be the first in the list.

Use -n to run multiple instances of GIMP. For example use gimp-2.10 to start GIMP in the default system language and LANGUAGE=en gimp-2.10 -n to start another instance of GIMP in English; this is very useful for translators.
Command Line Arguments
At the top of each Tab menu an entry opens the dialog's context menu which contains operations specific to that particular type of dialog. For example the context menu for the Layers tab is Layers Menu which contains a set of operations for manipulating layers.
Add Tab opens into a submenu allowing you to add a large variety of dockable dialogs as new tabs.

There are a few important actions that do alter an image but cannot be undone
Closing the image
The Undo History is a component of the image so when the image is closed and all of its resources are freed the Undo History is gone. Because of this unless the image has not been modified since the last time it was saved GIMP always asks you to confirm that you really want to close the image.
Reverting the image
Reverting means reloading the image from the file. GIMP actually implements this by closing the image and creating a new image so the Undo History is lost as a consequence. Because of this if the image is unclean GIMP asks you to confirm that you really want to revert the image.
Layer Modes and Groups
A layer mode applied to a layer group acts on layers that are in this group only. A layer mode above a layer group acts on all layers underneath outside and inside the layer groups.
Original image
Layer Mode in or out Layer Group
We added a white layer in the layer group with saturation mode only square and triangle are grayed out.
Image-Dependent Scripts
Now scripts and filters that perform operations on an existing image are accessible directly by the appropriate menu. For example the script New Brush (script-fu-paste-as-brush) is integrated in the Edit image menu (EditPaste asNew Brush) that is more logical.
Furthermore a new Color menu has been created that regroups together all that concern works on colors the hue or level color adjustment tools etc
Filters menu and Script-Fu menu are regrouped in one Filters menu and organised according to new categories. Now if a plugin and a filter works similarly they are nearby in the menu.
The Script-Fu menu only appears if you have loaded additional scripts for example the gimp-resynthesizer pack corresponding to your Linux distribution (.deb .rpm .gz ).
Std Dev  Standard deviation. Gives an idea about how homogeneous the distribution of values in the interval is.
Median  For example the value of the fiftieth peak in a 100 peaks interval.
Pixels  The number of pixels in the active layer or selection.
Count  The number of pixels in a peak (when you click on the histogram) or in the interval.
Percentile  The ratio between the number of pixels in the interval and the total number of pixels in the active layer or selection.
X and Y resolution
Colorspace
You can create the new image as either an RGB image or a grayscale image. You cannot create an indexed image directly in this way but of course nothing prevents you from converting the image to indexed mode after it has been created.
You have four choices for the solid color that will fill the new image's background layer
Foreground color as shown in the Main Toolbox.
Under the layer list a set of buttons allows you to perform some basic operations on the layer list.
Here you can create a new layer. A dialog is opened which is described in New Layer.
Press the Shift key to open a new layer with last used values.
Here you can create a new layer group. A new layer is created where you can put layers down.
Layer groups are described in Layer groups.
The imported palette will be added to the Palettes dialog and automatically saved in your personal palettes folder when you quit GIMP so it will be available in future sessions.
Duplicate Palette creates a new palette by copying the palette that is currently selected and brings up a Palette Editor so that you can alter the palette. The result will automatically be saved in your personal palettes folder when you quit GIMP so it will be available from the Palettes dialog in future sessions.
Currently this operation is not implemented and the menu entry will always be insensitive.
This command allows you to copy the palette file location to clipboard. You can then paste it in a text editor.
Delete Palette removes the palette from the Palettes dialog and deletes the disk file in which it is stored. Before it acts it asks you confirm that you really want to do these things. Note that you cannot remove any of the palettes that are supplied with GIMP only palettes you have added yourself.
If you quit without having saved your image GIMP asks you if you really want to do so if the Confirm closing of unsaved images option is checked in the System Resources page of the Preferences dialog.

In this view instead of a grid you see a list of patterns each labeled with its name and size. Clicking on a row in the list sets that pattern as GIMP's current pattern just as it does in the grid view.
If you double-click on the name of a pattern you will be able to edit the name. Note that you are only allowed to rename patterns that you have added yourself not the ones that are supplied with GIMP. If you edit a name that you don't have permission to change as soon as you hit return or move to a different control the name will revert back to its previous value.
Everything else in the List view works the same way as it does in the Grid view.
Pressing this button removes the pattern from the list and causes the file representing it to be deleted from disk. Note that you cannot remove any of the patterns that are supplied with GIMP and installed in the system patterns directory; you can only remove patterns that you have added to folders where you have write permission.
Pressing this button causes GIMP to rescan the folders in your pattern search path adding any newly discovered patterns to the list. This button is useful if you add new patterns to a folder and want to make them available without having to restart GIMP.

Using the Images dialog
In multi-window mode at the top of the dialog a drop-list of open images appears if the Show Image Selection option is checked in the Tab Menu.
At center open images appear as a list or a grid according to the selected mode. The current image is highlighted in list mode outlined in grid mode. With a double click on an image name you raise this image to the foreground of your screen. With a simple click you select this image so that the buttons of the dialog can act on it.
Grid and List modes preview size
In the Tab menu for the Images dialog you can choose between View as Grid and View as List. In Grid mode the images are laid out in a rectangular array. In List mode they are lined up vertically with each row showing a thumbnail of the contents of the image its name and its pixel dimensions.
New Pathcreates a new path adds it to the list in the Paths dialog and makes it the active path for the image. It brings up a dialog that allows you to give a name to the path. The new path is created with no anchor points so you will need to use the Path tool to give it some before you can use it for anything.
Raise Path moves the path one slot higher in the list in the Paths dialog. The position of a path in the list has no functional significance so this is simply a convenience to help you keep things organized.
Lower Pathmoves the path one slot lower in the list in the Paths dialog. The position of a path in the list has no functional significance so this is simply a convenience to help you keep things organized.
Duplicate Path creates a copy of the active path assigns it a unique name adds it to the list in the Paths dialog and makes it the active path for the image. The copy will be visible only if the original path was visible.
Merge Visible Paths takes all the paths in the image that are visible (that is all that show open eye symbols in the Paths dialog) and turns them into components of a single path. This may be convenient if you want to stroke them all in the same way etc.

The Cartoon filter modifies the active layer or selection so that it looks like a cartoon drawing. Its result is similar to a black felt pen drawing subsequently shaded with color. This is achieved by darkening areas that are already distinctly darker than their neighborhood.

This parameter controls the size of areas the filter works with. Large values result in very thick black areas and much less detail in the resulting image. Small values result in more subtle pen strokes and more details preserved.
This parameter controls the amount of black color added to the image. Small values make the blend from color regions to blackened areas smoother and dark lines themselves thinner and less noticeable. Larger values make the lines thicker darker and sharper. The maximum value makes the lines aliased. The best most natural results are usually achieved with an intermediate value.

RGB Noise filter options
Noise may be additive (uncorrelated) or multiplicative (correlated - also known as speckle noise). When checked every channel value is multiplied by an normally distributed value. So the noise depends on the channel values a greater channel value leads to more noise while dark colors (small values) tend to remain dark.
When this radio button is checked you can move each RGB slider separately. Otherwise sliders R G and B will be moved all together. The same relative noise will then be added to all channels in each pixel so the hue of pixels does not change much.

Selection and Tool
Much of the behavior of the plugin is determined by options set outside of the plugin such as the current selection or settings for gimp tools. These settings can be changed while the plugin is running.
In contrast to options within the plugin changing the current selection or tool settings will not redraw the pattern. To draw the change click the Redraw button at the bottom of the plugin.
The Current Selection
As in most plugins the current selection determines the area where the pattern will be rendered. Typically this would be a rectangular selection. There is however an additional way the selection can be used.
A Brief Tutorial
This is a rather complex plug-in so to help you understand it we'll guide you through an example where you'll create a leaf or branch.
Many forms of life and especially plants are built like mathematical fractals i.e. a shape that reproduces or repeats itself indefinitely into the smallest detail. You can easily reproduce the shape of a leaf or a branch by using four (or more) fractals. Three fractals make up the tip and sides of the leaf and the fourth represents the stem.
Before invoking the filter Select FileNew Image. Add a transparent layer with LayersLayers and ChannelsNew Layer. Set the foreground color in the toolbox to black and set the background to white.
Open IFS Fractal. Start by rotating the right and bottom triangles so that they point upward. You'll now be able to see the outline of what's going to be the tip and sides of the leaf. (If you have problems it may help to know that the three vertices of a triangle are not equivalent.) DocksAdd tab
In the main window you can set Rendering and Camera parameters. The first three parameters in the Render display are Brightness Contrast and Gamma. The result of these options is visible in the Preview window but it's generally better to stick to the default values and correct the rendered image later with Image/Colors.
The other three parameters affect the rendering process and don't show in the preview window. Sample Density which controls the resolution of the rendered pattern is the most important of these. The Camera parameters allow you to zoom and offset the flame pattern until you're happy with what you see in the preview window. Flame also offers the possibility to store and load your favorite patterns.

The Edit Flame dialog
The dialog shows nine different windows. The pattern displayed in the center is the current pattern and the eight windows surrounding it are random variations of that pattern. Clicking on the central image creates eight new variations which can be adjusted with the Speed control. You select a variation by clicking on it and it instantly replaces the image in the middle. To pick a certain character or theme for the variations you can choose from nine different themes in the Variations menu. You can also use Randomize which replaces the current pattern with a new random pattern.
Saturation tab
In this tab you can set how Saturation component of the HSV color model will be used in pattern calculation.
These options are similar to Hue tab options.

CMY CMYK
Subtractive color synthesis
CMYK is a color model which has components for Cyan Magenta Yellow and Black. It is a subtractive color model and that fact is important when an image is printed. It is complementary to the RGB color model.
The last of these values K (Black) doesn't contribute to the color but merely serves to darken the other colors. The letter K is used for Black to prevent confusion since B usually stands for Blue.
Use JPEG to create web graphics or if you don't want your image to take up a lot of space. JPEG is a good format for photographs and for computer-generated images (CGI). It is not well suited for
digital line drawings (for example screenshots or vector graphics) in which there are many neighboring pixels with the same color values few colors and hard edges
Black and white images (only black and white one bit per pixel) or
half-toned images (newsprint).
Other formats such as GIF PNG or JBIG are far better for these kinds of images.
The GIMP developers have made a great effort to keep the XCF file format compatible across versions. If you create a file using GIMP 2.0 it ought to be possible to open the file in GIMP 1.2. However some of the information in the file may not be usable for example GIMP 2.0 has a much more sophisticated way of handling text than GIMP 1.2 so a text layer from a GIMP 2.0 XCF file will appear as an ordinary image layer if the file is opened in GIMP 1.2.
Documentation about XCF format can be found at .
XMP is an acronym for Extensible Metadata Platform. It is a metadata format based on XML used in PDF and photographs. Report to  for detailed explanations.
YCbCr is a color model which was developed for the PAL television standard as a simple modification to the YUV color model. In the meantime it has become the CCIR-601 standard for image and video recording. For example it is used for JPEG pictures and MPEG videos and therefore also on DVDs video CDs and for most other widespread digital video standards. Note that a color model is still not a color space since it doesn't determine which colors are actually meant by red green and blue. For a color space there must still be a reference to a specific absolute color value.
There are color models which do not express a color by the additive basic colors red green and blue (RGB) but by other properties for example the brightness-color model. Here the criteria are the basic brightness of the colors (from black through gray to white) the colors with the largest portion (red orange yellow green blue violet or other pure colors that lie between them) and the saturation of the colors (gaudy to pale). This color model is based on the ability of the eye to recognize small differences in luminosity better than small color differences and to recognize those better than small differences in saturation. That makes gray text written on a black background easy to read but blue text on a red background very hard to read even with the same basic brightness. Such color models are called brightness-color models.
GIMP 2.10 ships with a number of improvements requested by digital painters. One of the most interesting new additions here is the MyPaint Brush tool (Y) that first appeared in the GIMP-Painter fork.
The Smudge tool got updates specifically targeted in painting use case. The new No erase effect option prevents the tools from changing alpha of pixels. And the foreground color can now be blended into smudged pixels controlled by a new Flow slider where 0 means no blending.
All painting tools now have explicit Hardness and Force sliders except for the MyPaint Brush tool that only has the Hardness slider.
Most importantly GIMP now supports canvas rotation and flipping to help illustrators checking proportions and perspective.
A new Brush lock to view option gives you a choice whether you want a brush locked to a certain zoom level and rotation angle of the canvas. The option is available for all painting tools that use a brush except for the MyPaint Brush tool.
Introduction to the Help Menu
Contents of the Help menu
The Help menu contains commands that assist you while you are working with GIMP.

The vertical gradient it represents the destination the output tonal scale. It ranges from 0 (black) to 255 (white) from Shadows to Highlights.
The chart the curve is drawn on a grid and goes from the bottom left corner to the top right corner. The pointer x/y position is permanently displayed in the top left part of the grid. By default this curve is straight because every input level corresponds to the same output tone. GIMP automatically places a point at both ends of the curve for black (0) and white (255).
If you click on the curve a new point is created. When the mouse pointer goes over a point it takes the form of a small hand. You can click-and-drag the point to bend the curve.
If you click outside the curve a point is also created and the curve includes it automatically.  If you Ctrl-click outside the curve the Y-coordinate will snap to the original curve this is particularly useful for adding points along the curve.
Unactive points are white. The active point is black. You can activate a point by clicking on it. You can also swap the point activation by using the Left and Right arrow keys of your keyboard.
Overlap = 100. Hue = 15. Colors become (192;255;1) (168;255;1) (162;255;1). Because of overlap greenish is less green and reddish is less red.
Hue The slider and the input box allow you to select a hue in the color circle (-180 180).
Lightness The slider and the input box allow you to select a value (luminosity) -100 100.
Lightness changes here concern a color range while they concern a color tone with Curves and Levels tools which work on color channels. If you change the Yellow lightness with Hue-Saturation all yellow pixels will be changed while only dark bright or medium pixels luminosity will be changed with Curves or Levels tools.
Saturation The slider and the input box allow you to select a saturation -100 100.
The original image is a gray-scaled image with three stripes Shadows (64) Mid Tones (127) Highlights (192). The histogram shows three peaks one for each of the three tones.
The Value channel is selected. The black slider (Shadows) has been moved up to the Shadows peak. The 64 value became 0 and the Shadows stripe became black (0). The Gamma (mid tones) slider is automatically moved to the middle of the tone range. Mid tones are made darker to 84 and Highlights to 171.
Black slider has been moved
The white slider (highlights) has been moved up to the highlight peak. The 192 value became 255 and the highlight stripe became white. The Gamma (mid tones) slider is automatically moved to the middle of the tone range. Mid tones are made lighter to 169 and Shadows to 84.
White slider has been moved
Opacity the limit above which colors become opaque.
Color to Alpha modifies the transparency (and color) of the pixels based on their distance from the selected background color (the "Color" option) -- the closer they are to the background color the more transparent they become with the background color becoming fully transparent.
The transparency and opacity thresholds control how close colors should be to the background color before they become fully transparent and how far they should be from the background color before they remain fully opaque respectively. With the default values of 0 and 1 only the background color becomes fully transparent and only the colors farthest away from the background color remain fully opaque.
For example while the default values work well for removing a white background from a black object if the object is gray instead [fig. 1] it will become semi-transparent [fig. 2] since gray is midway between white and black. Lowering the opacity threshold to 0.5 fixes that by keeping all pixels that are gray or darker (all pixels whose distance from white is 0.5 or more on a [01] scale) fully opaque [fig. 3].
The transparency threshold works similarly raising it causes more colors in the neighborhood of the background color to become fully transparent. This is mostly useful with noisy images in which the background is not fully solid. However unlike in other cases when the transparency threshold is above 0 recomposing the result against the background color no longer reproduces the exact same image.
Stretch colors in HSV space
The Stretch Contrast HSV command does the same thing as the Stretch Contrast command except that it works in HSV color space rather than RGB color space and it preserves the Hue. Thus it independently stretches the ranges of the Hue Saturation and Value components of the colors. Occasionally the results are good often they are a bit odd. Stretch Contrast HSV operates on layers from RGB and Indexed images. If the image is Grayscale the menu entry is insensitive and grayed out.
You can access this command from the image menubar through ColorsAutoStretch Contrast HSV.
The active layer and its Red Green and Blue histograms before Stretch Contrast HSV.
The active layer and its Red Green and Blue histograms after Stretch Contrast HSV. Contrast luminosity and hues are enhanced.
Decompose command options
Following options are described with Decompose to layers checked.
If the RGB radio button is clicked a grey level image is created with three layers (Red Green and Blue) and two channels (Grey and Alpha).
This function is interesting when using Threshold tool. You can also perform operations like cutting pasting or moving selections in a single RBG channel. You can use an extracted grayscale as a selection or mask by saving it in a channel (right-clickgt;Selectgt;Save to a channel).
If the RGBA radio button is clicked a image is created similar at the RGB Decomposing with a additional Alpha layer filled with the transparencies values of the source image. Full transparent pixels are black and the full opaque pixels are white.
Example for the Border Average filter
Filter Border Average applied
This plug-in calculates the most often used color in a specified border of the active layer or selection. It can gather similar colors together so that they become predominant. The calculated color becomes the foreground color in the Toolbox. This filter is interesting when you have to find a Web page color background that differs as little as possible from your image border. The action of this filter is not registered in Undo History and can't be deleted with CtrlZ  it doesn't modify the image.
This filter is found in the image window menu under ColorsInfoBorder Average.

Applying Flip Layer Vertically
The layer after it has been flipped. It looks as if the image has been reflected along the central horizontal axis of the layer.
If you have created a floating selection a temporary layer called a floating layer or floating selection is added to the layer stack. As long as the floating layer persists you can work only on it. To work on the rest of the image you must anchor the floating layer to the former active layer with the Anchor layer command. If the image does not contain a floating selection this menu entry is insensitive and grayed out.
If there is an active selection tool the mouse pointer is displayed with an anchor icon when it is outside of the selection.
You can access this command from the image menubar through LayerAnchor layer
Default is Normal. The drop-down list offers all layer blend modes. On the right another drop-down list to select between Default or Legacy group of modes.
Layer blend modes are described in Layer Modes.
The space used by the layer mode. This option is not activated.
The layer's mode (sometimes referred to as its blend mode Normal Multiply etc.) determines how the color values of the layer and its backdrop are combined while the layer's composite mode determines how the alpha values of the layer and its backdrop are combined. (The layer's backdrop is the content against which the layer is composited; namely it's the combination of the layers below it.)
There are two regions of interest when compositing the layer against its backdrop the opaque region of the backdrop and the opaque region of the layer. The layer's blend mode determines how to combine the colors of the intersection of these two regions i.e. the common opaque region of both the backdrop and the layer (pixels belonging to only one of these regions don't need to be combined with anything and retain their original color.). The layer's composite mode determines which part of these regions to keep and which to discard.
Add Alpha channel to background layer
Add Alpha channel
Add Alpha Channel An alpha channel is automatically added into the Channel Dialog as soon as you add a second layer to your image. It represents the transparency of the image. If your image has only one layer this background layer has no Alpha channel. In this case you can Add an Alpha channel with this command.
You can access this command from the image menubar through LayerTransparencyAdd alpha Channel.
In addition at the Layer Dialog you can access it through Add Alpha Channel of its context pop-up menu.

Toolbox Fill
This tool fills a selection with the current foreground color. If you Ctrl+click and use the Bucket tool it will use the background color instead. Depending on how the tool options are set the Bucket Fill tool will either fill the entire selection or only parts whose colors are similar to the point you click on. The tool options also affect the way transparency is handled.
The amount of fill depends on what Fill Threshold you have specified. The fill threshold determines how far the fill will spread (similar to the way in which the magic wand works). The fill starts at the point where you click and spreads outward until the color or alpha value becomes too different.
Eraser tool icon in the Toolbox
The Eraser is used to remove areas of color from the current layer or from a selection of this layer. If the Eraser is used on something that does not support transparency (a selection mask channel a layer mask or the Background layer if it lacks an alpha channel) then erasing will show the background color as displayed in the Color Area of the Toolbox (in case of a mask the selection will be modified). Otherwise erasing will produce either partial or full transparency depending on the settings for the tool options. You can learn more on how to add an alpha channel to a layer in .
Eraser and Alpha channel
The image has an Alpha channel. The Eraser shows transparency.
If you need to erase some group of pixels completely leaving no trace behind of their previous contents you should check the "Hard edge" box in the Tool Options. Otherwise sub-pixel brush placement will cause partial erasure at the edges of the brush-stroke even if you use a hard-edged brush.

Clicking on the Auto Shrink Selection button will make the selection automatically shrink to the nearest rectangular shape including elements in the selection. The algorithm for finding the best rectangle to shrink to is intelligent which in this case means that it sometimes does surprisingly sophisticated things and sometimes does surprisingly strange things. In any case if the region that you want to select has a solid-colored surround auto-shrinking will always pick it out correctly. Note that the resulting selection does not need to have the same shape as the one you sweep out.
Do the transformation the usual way and confirm it when finished. It could be a good idea to set the Guides to No guides to get the path more recognizable.
When the transformation is finished choose the path tool and click on the changed path to activate it again for further working on it.

The Shear tool in Toolbox
Strength set displacement of pixels during warping. The maximum of displacement is on the brush diameter.
Spacing  TODO (work in progress)
Abyss Policy
Abyss is a term used by GIMP developers for data outside the input buffer. The warp tool moves pixels from one point to another. Some pixels may come from outside the layer boundary. These pixels don't actually exist anywhere and therefore don't have any associated color; yet some color must be assigned to them.
Abyss policy has a drop-down list that allows you to fill empty areas in different manners
Crop tool
The Crop Tool is used to crop or clip an image. It works on all the layers of the image visible and invisible. This tool is often used to remove borders or to eliminate unwanted areas to provide you with a more focused working area. It is also useful if you need a specific image size that does not match the original dimensions of your image.
Just like the selection tools the new crop tool has been enhanced with the v2.4 release. The resize handles actually resize the crop rectangle instead of providing both resize and move functionality. The tool behaves more naturally and consistently with other GIMP tools. To move simply drag the rectangle clicking within the area. Resizing is possible in one or two axes at the same time dragging the handle-bars on the sides and corners. The outside area can be darkened with a nice passepartout effect to better get the idea of how the final crop will look like. To validate cropping click inside the crop rectangle or press the Enter key.
When the mouse becomes the moving cross-hair you can use the keyboard arrow keys to move the crop rectangle. Holding the Shift key down allows to move by increments of 25 pixels.
You can use Guides to position the crop area. Make sure that the ViewSnap to Guides option is checked.
New feature in GIMP-2.10
GIMP-2.10 shows relative coordinates (horizontal or vertical) when moving guides and sample points. Coordinates are relative to the start of moving.

Find Info About Your Image

Finding Info
When you need to find out information about your image Use ImageImage Properties to open the Image Properties dialog which contains information about the image size resolution mode and much more.
Image Properties Dialog
The .vbr format is used for parametric brushes i. e. brushes created using the Brush Editor. There is really no other meaningful way of obtaining files in this format.
MYB
The .myb format is used for MyPaint brushes. Please refer to  for more information.
To make a brush available place it in one of the folders in GIMP's brush search path. By default the brush search path includes two folders the system brushes folder which you should not use or alter and the brushes folder inside your personal GIMP directory. You can add new folders to the brush search path using the Brush Folders page of the Preferences dialog. Any GBR GIH or VBR file included in a folder in the brush search path will show up in the Brushes dialog the next time you start GIMP or as soon as you press the Refresh button in the Brushes dialog.
When you create a new parametric brush using the Brush Editor it is automatically saved in your personal brushes folder.
MNG
Export MNG File Dialog
MNG is acronym for Multiple-Image Network Graphics.
The main problem is that Konqueror is the only Web navigator that recognizes the MNG animation format. Please see .

If you are familiar with other programming languages like C/C++ Perl or Java you know that you don't need white space around mathematical operators to properly form an expression
3+5 3 +5 3+ 5
These are all accepted by C/C++ Perl and Java compilers. However the same is not true for Scheme. You must have a space after a mathematical operator (or any other function name or operator) in Scheme for it to be correctly interpreted by the Scheme interpreter.
Practice a bit with simple mathematical equations in the Script-Fu Console until you're totally comfortable with these initial concepts.
Variables And Functions
Editing And Storing Your Scripts
Up until now we've been working in the Script-Fu Console. Now however we're going to switch to editing script text files.
Where you place your scripts is a matter of preference mdash; if you have access to GIMP's default script directory you can place your scripts there. However I prefer keeping my personal scripts in my own script directory to keep them separate from the factory-installed scripts.
In the /.config/GIMP/2.10/ directory that GIMP made off of your home directory you should find a directory called scripts. GIMP will automatically look in your /.config/GIMP/2.10/ directory for a scripts directory and add the scripts in this directory to the Script-Fu database. You should place your personal scripts here.
The Bare Essentials
All we're doing here is setting the buffer based on the height of the text and adding it twice to both the height and width of our new image. (We add it twice to both dimensions because the buffer needs to be added to both sides of the text.)
Now that we have resized the image to allow for a buffer we need to center the text within the image. This is done by moving it to the (x y) coordinates of (theBuffer theBuffer). I added this line after resizing the layer and the image
(gimp-layer-set-offsets theText theBuffer theBuffer)
Go ahead and save your script and try it out after refreshing the database.
All that is left to do is return our image the layer and the text layer. After displaying the image we add this line
From version 2.4 GIMP incorporated a special remove red eye filter. Make a selection with one of the selection tools of the red part of the eye and then choose the Remove Red Eye filter. Perhaps you have to fiddle around a bit with the threshold slider to get the right color.
Saving Your Results
What file format should you use to save the results of your work and should you resize it? The answers depend on what you intend to use the image for.
If you intend to open the image in GIMP again for further work you should save it in GIMP's native XCF format (i. e. name it something.xcf) because this is the only format that guarantees that none of the information in the image is lost.
If you intend to print the image on paper you should avoid shrinking the image except by cropping it. The reason is that printers are capable of achieving much higher resolutions than video monitors mdash; 600 to 1400 dpi (dots per inch the physical density) for typical printers as compared to 72 to 100 pixels per inch for monitors. A 3000nbsp;xnbsp;5000-pixel image looks huge on a monitor but it only comes to about 5 inches by 8 inches on paper at 600 ppi. There is usually no good reason to expand the image either you can't increase the true resolution that way and it can always be scaled up at the time it is printed. As for the file format it will usually be fine to use JPEG at a quality level of 75 to 85. In rare cases where there are large swaths of nearly uniform color you may need to set the quality level even higher or use a lossless format such as TIFF instead.
Toggle QuickMask mode off using the left-bottom button in the image window the selection will be displayed with marching ants.

Then GIMP creates a computer array from this stack with the Dimensions you have set. You can use four dimensions.
In computer science an array has a myarray(xyz) form for a 3 dimensions array (3D). It's easy to imagine a 2D array on a paper it's an array with rows and columns  With a 3d array we don't talk rows and columns but Dimensions and Ranks. The first dimension is along x axis the second dimension along y axis the third along z axis. Each dimension has ranks of cells. 
To fill up this array GIMP starts retrieving cells from the top of stack. The way it fills the array reminds that of an odometer right rank digits turn first and when they reach their maximum left rank digits start running. If you have some memories of Basic programming you will have with an array(422) the following succession (111)(112)(121)(122)(211)(212)(222)(311). (422). We will see this later in an example.
Besides the rank number that you can give to each dimension you can also give them a Selection mode. You have several modes that will be applied when drawing
GIMP selects a rank from the concerned dimension according to the order ranks have in that dimension.
You can get the brush size varying in three ways
Using the Size slider of the tool options. Pencil Paintbrush Eraser Airbrush Clone Heal Perspective Clone Blur/Sharpen and Dodge/Burn tools have a slider to vary the brush size.

In the main window of GIMP click on EditPreferences.
None  GIMP uses the colorimetric profile of your monitor.
Select color profile from disk  if you have one.
Try to use the system monitor profile  If checked GIMP will try to use the display color profile of the system windows handler. Else the configured monitor profile is used.
This option is about how colors are converted from the color space of your image to your display device. Four modes are available Perceptual Relative colorimetric Saturation and  Absolute colorimetric.
Relative colorimetric is usually the best choice (default). Unless you use a LUT monitor profile (most monitor profile are matrix) choosing perceptual intent actually gives you relative colorimetric.
GIMP Help is supplied in the form of HTML files i. e. web pages. You can view them using either a special help browser that comes with GIMP or a web browser of your choice. Here you choose which option to use. Because the help pages were carefully checked to make sure they work well with GIMP's browser whereas other web browsers are somewhat variable in their support of features the safer option is to use the internal browser; but really any modern web browser should be okay.
Note that the GIMP help browser is not available on all platforms. If it is missing this option is hidden and the standard web browser will be used to read the help pages.
Default value is 100 (0-1000) items in the history.

A higher precision profile provides higher accuracy in color matching but requires more time for reading the color patches.
For a typical workflow a normal precision profile is sufficient.
The high precision profile also requires more paper and printer ink.

Be careful not to bury low cards. Try to keep Tableau piles from emptying.
Four piles top right. Built from Ace to King in suit.
Reserves
Four piles at top left. Each reserve can only hold one card.
Eight piles underneath the Foundation and Reserves. The cards are dealt face up on to the Tableau with seven cards each in the first four slots and six cards each in the last four slots.
Move all cards to the foundation piles.
Build foundations up in suit and tableau piles down in suit. If no moves are available (or you just feel like it) click on the empty top left slot for a redeal.
Redeals are accomplished by placing the tableau piles on top of each other in order starting from the last pile. Then the deck is simply turned over and redealt four cards at a time back to the tableau. If no moves are made redealing will not alter the arrangement of the cards. Therefore the game is lost if no move is possible immediately after a redeal.
Note a degenerate case occurs whenever after a redeal the last tableau pile contains only one card and the only move possible is from the final tableau pile one before it. Making this move and redealing only results in the original card arrangement. AisleRiot will end the game if this situation is detected.
Each card placed in the foundation piles scores one point.
Every card moved from the Tableau on top of a card in the Foundation scores one point.
Make sure to look at all the cards coming up and be sure you're not going to lock any cards that are necessary to move the one on top.
Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing on to the Tableau. Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste. No redeals
Deal face up seven overlapping rows starting with one card on the first row increasing by one per row and staggering the piles as to achieve a pyramid.
Cards are flipped singly from the Stock to the Waste. There is no redeal.
Four piles on top to the right of Stock. Place an Ace on the first pile a two on the second pile a three on the third pile and a four on the fourth pile. The first Foundation pile is built up by one the second is built up by two the third by three and the fourth by four all of which wrap around to Ace when it reaches past thirteen. cards in Foundations are no longer in play. Suits do not matter.
Four piles placed underneath Foundations. Cards in Reserve can only be played on to Foundation piles. Cards moved from Waste can be placed on any of the Reserve piles.
Build on to Foundations by ones twos threes and fours for piles one two three and four respectively. Cards are dealt singly in to the Waste from the Stock. However as the Waste pile can only hold one card this card must immediately be played on to a Foundation pile or on to any of the four Reserve piles. Cards in the Reserve piles cannot be rearranged.
Each card moved to Foundations scores one point.
Hone your skills for this game. Luck will not get you very far here. Try not to cover cards you might need sooner. Consider saving a column just for kings (as they are the last card to be played on each Foundation).
Click on Kings to remove them. All other cards can be removed in pairs that add up to thirteen as long as the two cards are touching horizontally vertically or diagonally.
Remove cards higher up on the table first as this creates more movement within the grid.
Four piles on left. To be built up in suit from Ace to King.
Seven piles. Deal three rows face down followed by three rows face up. Then deal two more rows face up in the middle five piles.
Cards in the Tableau are built down by suit. Groups of cards can be moved regardless of sequence. Groups of cards in sequence can be moved into an appropriate and receptive Foundation pile. An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with a King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom.
Build down regardless of suit. Sequences of cards in the same suit can be moved as a unit. Empty piles can be filled with any card or legal sequence.
Clicking on the Stock pile at any time deals a card face up to every pile. However all piles must be non-empty. If an empty pile exists an error message will appear.
A sequence of cards going down from King down to Ace can be moved to a foundation pile. Once there these cards are no longer in play.
There are three possible types of deck. Each deck has 104 cards.
The deck is an octuple deck of Spades only. This is the simplest of the spider decks and a good way to learn the basics.
All play is on the Waste pile. Cards faced down are not part of the current scoring run.
Deal 18 cards face down in the form of three triangles with three rows in each triangle increasing with one card in the first row to three in the last. Connect the triangles by dealing another 10 cards face up in the bottom row. End cards of each row should overlap the end cards of the row above and interior cards should overlap two adjacent cards of that row.
Remove all cards from the Tableau.

The PostLogin script is run before pamopensession is called and the PreSession script is called after. This allows the system administrator to add any scripting to the login process either before or after PAM initializes the session.
If you wish to make GDM work with other types of authentication mechanisms (such as a fingerprint or SmartCard reader) then you should implement this by using a PAM service module for the desired authentication type rather than by trying to modify the GDM code directly. Refer to the PAM documentation on your system. How to do this is frequently discussed on the gdm-list@gnome.org mail list so you can refer to the list archives for more information.
PAM does have some limitations regarding being able to work with multiple types of authentication at the same time like supporting the ability to accept either SmartCard and the ability to type the username and password into the login program. There are techniques that are used to make this work and it is best to research how this problem is commonly solved when setting up such a configuration.
If automatic login does not work on a system check to see if the "gdm-autologin" PAM stack is defined in the PAM configuration. For this to work it is necessary to use a PAM module that simply does no authentication or which simply returns PAMSUCCESS from all of its public interfaces. Assuming your system has a pamallow.so PAM module which does this a PAM configuration to enable "gdm-autologin" would look like this
The above setup will cause no lastlog entry to be generated. If a lastlog entry is desired then use the following for the session

Set to a list of users to always exclude in the Face Browser. This value is set to a list of users separated by commas. Note that the setting in the custom.conf overrides the default value so if you wish to add additional users to the list then you need to set the value to the default value with additional users appended to the list.

GDM installs its own mandatory policy to lock down some settings for security.

How to import an existing ICC profile using a Linux system.

Documents normally shows only documents that are in standard folders such as Documents or Downloads. You can add extra folders that you want to use from the Search preference panel. You may want to do this if you keep some of your documents in a non-standard location such as another folder on your computer or on an external hard disk.
Open the Activities overview and start typing Search.
Click on Search to open the panel.
Press the button in the bottom-right of the window which will open Search Locations.
Press + to add a new search location.
Quickly turn Screen Reader on and off
You can turn Screen Reader on and off by clicking the accessibility icon in the top bar and selecting Screen Reader.
Have a delay between a key being pressed and that letter appearing on the screen.
Turn on slow keys
Turn on slow keys if you would like there to be a delay between pressing a key and that letter being displayed on the screen. This means that you have to hold down each key you want to type for a little while before it appears. Use slow keys if you accidentally press several keys at a time when you type or if you find it difficult to press the right key on the keyboard first time.
On the other hand if you are backing up the data on your home computer then hourly backups would likely be unnecessary. You may find it helpful to consider the following points when planning your backup schedule
The amount of time you spend on the computer.
How often and by how much the data on the computer changes.
If the data you want to back up is lower priority or subject to few changes like music e-mails and family photos then weekly or even monthly backups may suffice. However if you happen to be in the middle of a tax audit more frequent backups may be necessary.
As a general rule the amount of time in between backups should be no more than the amount of time you are willing to spend re-doing any lost work. For example if spending a week re-writing lost documents is too long for you you should back up at least once per week.
Your Bluetooth adapter or dongle may not have been recognized by the computer. This could be because drivers for the adapter are not installed. Some Bluetooth adapters are not supported on Linux so you may not be able to get the right drivers for them. In this case you will probably have to get a different Bluetooth adapter.
Adapter is not switched on
Make sure that your Bluetooth adapter is switched on. Open the Bluetooth panel and check that it is not disabled.
Device Bluetooth connection switched off
Check that Bluetooth is turned on on the device you are trying to connect to and that it is discoverable or visible. For example if you are trying to connect to a phone make sure that it is not in airplane mode.
Using an expensive device such as a ColorMunki works out cheaper only if you are profiling a large number of ink sets or paper types.
If you change your ink supplier make sure you recalibrate the printer!
Calibrating your scanner is important to capture accurate colors.
How do I calibrate my scanner?
If you want your scanner to represent the color accurately in scans you should calibrate it.
A color profile is a set of data that characterizes either a device such as a projector or a color space such as sRGB.
Most color profiles are in the form of an ICC profile which is a small file with a .ICC or .ICM file extension.
Color profiles can be embedded into images to specify the gamut range of the data. This ensures that users see the same colors on different devices.
Every device that is processing color should have its own ICC profile and when this is achieved the system is said to have an end-to-end color-managed workflow. With this kind of workflow you can be sure that colors are not being lost or modified.
A color space is a defined range of colors.
If Perform write-benchmark is checked the benchmark will test how fast data can be read from and written to the disk. This will take longer to complete.
When the test is finished the results will appear on the graph. The green points and connecting lines indicate the samples taken; these correspond to the right axis showing access time plotted against the bottom axis representing percentage time elapsed during the benchmark. The blue line represents read rates while the red line represents write rates; these are shown as access data rates on the left axis plotted against percentage of the disk traveled from the outside to the spindle along the bottom axis.
Below the graph values are displayed for minimum maximum and average read and write rates average access time and time elapsed since the last benchmark test.

If you do not want a file or folder any more you can delete it. When you delete an item it is moved to the Trash folder where it is stored until you empty the trash. You can restore items in the Trash folder to their original location if you decide you need them or if they were accidentally deleted.
To send a file to the trash
Select the item you want to place in the trash by clicking it once.
Press Delete on your keyboard. Alternatively drag the item to the Trash in the sidebar.
The file will be moved to the trash and you’ll be presented with an option to Undo the deletion. The Undo button will appear for a few seconds. If you select Undo the file will be restored to its original location.
You can also rename a file from the properties window.
When you rename a file only the first part of the name of the file is selected not the file extension (the part after the last .). The extension normally denotes what type of file it is (for example file.pdf is a PDF document) and you usually do not want to change that. If you need to change the extension as well select the entire file name and change it.
If you renamed the wrong file or named your file improperly you can undo the rename. To revert the action immediately click the menu button in the toolbar and select Undo Rename or press CtrlZ to restore the former name.
Valid characters for file names
You can use any character except the / (slash) character in file names. Some devices however use a file system that has more restrictions on file names. Therefore it is a best practice to avoid the following characters in your file names | \ ? * lt; "  gt; /.

What do WEP and WPA mean?
WEP and WPA (along with WPA2) are names for different encryption tools used to secure your wireless connection. Encryption scrambles the network connection so that no one can “listen in” to it and look at which web pages you are viewing for example. WEP stands for Wired Equivalent Privacy and WPA stands for Wireless Protected Access. WPA2 is the second version of the WPA standard.
Using some encryption is always better than using none but WEP is the least secure of these standards and you should not use it if you can avoid it. WPA2 is the most secure of the three. If your wireless card and router support WPA2 that is what you should use when setting up your wireless network.

Set up a basic project in Anjuta
Create a project in Anjuta
Before you start coding you'll need to set up a new project in Anjuta. This will create all of the files you need to build and run the code later on. It's also useful for keeping everything together.
Start Anjuta and click FileNewProject to open the project wizard.
Lines 8‒9 We do two things in each line
Use Iter's method getvalueat which requires only one argument the column number to retrieve starting at 0. As our SELECT command returns only two columns we are retrieving columns 0 and 1.
The method getvalueat returns the field in GLib's GValue format. A simple way to convert this format to a string is by using GDA's global function valuestringify. That's what we are doing here and we store the results in the variables idfield and namefield.
Line 11 Concatenate the two fields to make one text line separated by "=gt;" and store it in the text variable.
Line 14 After the loop is finished we have all the records formatted in the text variable. In this line we just set the contents of the TextView with that variable.
Welcome to the Passwords and Keys help guide. Passwords and Keys creates and stores security tokens helping to keep your information secure on your computer and secure when you send information over a network.
Using Passwords and Keys you can
Copy and save passwords that are difficult to remember. To group related passwords create keyrings.
Create and manage PGP keys.
Create and manage SSH keys.
Optionally add your email address and a comment to describe the key.
Press Create.
In the password dialog enter a password for the key. Retype the password to confirm your choice.
Press OK to finish.
Passwords and Keys will take some time to generate your key. While your key is being created move your mouse around press some keys on your keyboard or browse the web. This will help Passwords and Keys to create a truly random key. The key will be listed under GnuPG keys.
Can I sign my own keys?
When you create a new GnuPG key it is automatically signed by you. Any new subkeys created using a GnuPG key will also be signed automatically.
A subkey is always bound to a master key in a PGP keypair. It is used for encryption.
What is a subkey?
Though it is very important to keep your keys safe it can become quite tedious to do so when you have many keys. Passwords and Keys provides a simple solution to key safety by using subkeys for signing and encryption.
Always ensure that your subkey expires before your master key since a subkey is useless when its master key has expired.
See all the subkeys listed under a PGP key.
Where are my subkeys listed?
You can check the contents of a keypair to see the properties of a subkey.
To see all the subkeys in a PGP key
System database files located in  cannot be edited because they are written in GVDB format. In order to change system settings using a text editor you can modify keyfiles found in keyfile directories. Each keyfile directory corresponds to a particular system database file and has the same name as the database file with a “.d” extension appended (for example /etc/dconf/db/local.d). All keyfile directories are found in  and each one contains keyfiles in a special format that can be compiled into the  database.
A keyfile in this directory will look something like this

Disable login using a fingerprint reader
Create the key file /etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-login to provide information for the local database.
/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-login
To prevent the user from overriding these settings create the file /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/login with the following content
/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/fingerprintreader
GSettings overrides are used by distributions to adjust default settings.
Why should I not use GSettings overrides?
GSettings overrides are used by distributions to adjust default settings for the GNOME desktop and apps. dconf overrides were designed for system administrators to adjust default settings and set mandatory settings for the GNOME desktop and apps.

Dasher is an information-efficient text-entry interface driven by natural continuous pointing gestures. Dasher is a competitive text-entry system wherever a full-size keyboard cannot be used - for example on a palmtop or wearable computer or when operating a computer one-handed (by joystick touchscreen or mouse) or zero-handed (i.e. by head-mouse or eyetracker). This document describes version 4.2.0 of Dasher.
Dasher can be started by selecting Dasher from the Accessibility  submenu of the Main Menu or by running the command dasher on the command line.
What's New
For each language there is an alphabet file (or possibly more than one alphabet file). On the Dasher website we aim to supply at least one training text for each language. If we don't have a good training text for your language please help us by making one and sending it to us.
See the Dasher website for the list of languages supported by Dasher. As of October 2005 all the major languages of the world are well supported with the exception of Japanese and Chinese for which Dasher version 3 offers only phonetic support (hiragana and pin-yin). In Dasher version 4 we will provide full support for Japanese and Chinese.
Dasher Special Needs Guide
Dasher is designed on the principle of getting as much information as possible from the gestures you can make.
Continuous gestures (conveyed via a joystick trackpad head mouse or gaze tracker for example) often achieve the highest rates of writing.

Google Talk is a type of Jabber account. These instructions hold for Google Talk accounts as well.
Whenever possible communication between Empathy and the Jabber server is encrypted. If encrypted communication is not possible messages may be sent unencrypted. Select Encryption required to prevent Empathy from communicating with the Jabber server when encryption is not possible.
If you have multiple applications (for instance on separate computers) connected to your account at the same time you can set a resource to uniquely identify each one. By default Empathy will use Telepathy as the resource.
You can set the priority to specify which application should receive incoming messages from your contacts. New messages will be sent to the application with the highest priority.
Empathy will use default settings to connect to the Jabber server based on your login ID. For some Jabber servers you will need to enter custom server settings manually. These settings should be provided for you by your Jabber provider.
What information is sent
What is possible to send is your country region locality area street building floor room and postal code longitude latitude and altitude speed and bearing.
The accuracy and the quantity of information about your geographical position are based on the software or on the infrastructure used to discover your position.
Different kind of networks may have different accuracy settings and may send different information. The use of external devices such as GPS or mobile phone will increase the accuracy of the information sent.
When the privacy mode is enabled nothing more precise than your city will be sent even if you are using an external device.

The middle pane contains Clip configuration Transitions and Title editor. You can switch between them by selecting the appropriate tab. The Clip configuration allows you to activate deactivate or configure settings of effects applied to a selected clip. Transitions let you pick and configure the transition type when two clips overlap in the timeline. With Title editor you can create new clips with titles or add titles to existing ones.
Managing your imported clips with the Media Library

Grouping clips in timeline
Select multiple clips in the timeline.
Click the Group clips button on the timeline toolbar or press CtrlG.
You can now select edit and move the clips all at once.
Ungrouping clips in timeline
Moving clips along the timeline
You can move a clip within a layer or move it to a different layer.
Click and drag a single clip to move it and release the mouse button to place it. Dragging horizontally keeps the clip on the same layer but dragging it vertically moves the clip to a different layer (see Understanding layers for more information).
To move a clip to an existing layer drag it on the layer at the desired position and release it. To move a clip to a new layer drag it to the middle space between two existing layers. Once the space between the respective layers is highlighted release it.
To move multiple clips at the same time use the Ctrl or Shift keys to select multiple clips (see Selection and grouping for more details). Selected clips do not need to be on the same layer. Then drag the clips just as you would do for a single clip; their position relative to each other will be preserved.
Note that Shotwell can optionally write metadata (such as tags and titles) to photo files. For more information see the section Photo files.
Correct photos where people have red eyes because of the camera's flash.
Removing red-eye
Red-eye occurs when the camera's flash reflects off the pupil of someone's eye. To eliminate this in a photo use the Red-eye tool.
Click Red-eye. A circle will appear on the photo.
external ref='figures/trashprocess.png' md5='ed596bda34c2f4a79a310fbc8bb51fd2'
Delete process
This diagram shows how a photo when deleted is first put into Shotwell's trash. If you delete it from Shotwell's trash it is put into your computer's trash. If you delete it from your computer's trash the photo is finally and irretrievably deleted from your computer.
Removing photos from the library
Select the photos to remove and choose EditMove to Trash. (You can also press the Delete key.) The photos will be moved from your library to Shotwell's Trash.
Some cameras have the ability to store data directly off the sensor and into a file that contains extra color information; this is commonly referred to as 'RAW' or 'camera RAW' and Shotwell supports these files as well.
Since RAW photographs normally cannot be displayed directly but must be first developed - that is have their extra information interpreted and readied for displaying - most cameras will either embed a JPEG inside a RAW-format file or produce a JPEG alongside the RAW file at the time the snapshot is taken. The latter is referred to throughout this document as RAW+JPEG. If you import a RAW+JPEG pair Shotwell will keep them paired and treat them as one item in your library.
When you import a RAW file you can choose to either use the camera's internally-developed JPEG or Shotwell's by selecting PhotosDeveloper in the menus.
Changing between developers will cause all edits made to a photograph to be discarded.
In order to publish or use a RAW photograph in most other software it has to be exported first. Shotwell can export your RAW photos in JPEG PNG TIFF or BMP format and when publishing will internally export a JPEG version for you and publish that.

Boolean Variables
Boolean variables store only one of two values TRUE or FALSE. A number 0 evaluates to FALSE every other value evaluates to TRUE.
Date Variables
Date variables can only contain dates and time values stored in an internal format. Values assigned to Date variables with Dateserial Datevalue Timeserial or Timevalue are automatically converted to the internal format. Date-variables are converted to normal numbers by using the Day Month Year or the Hour Minute Second function. The internal format enables a comparison of date/time values by calculating the difference between two numbers. These variables can only be declared with the key word Date.

Breakpoints and Single Step Execution
You can check each line in your Basic program for errors using single step execution. Errors are easily traced since you can immediately see the result of each step. A pointer in the breakpoint column of the Editor indicates the current line. You can also set a breakpoint if you want to force the program to be interrupted at a specific position.
Double-click in the breakpoint column at the left of the Editor window to toggle a breakpoint at the corresponding line. When the program reaches a breakpoint the program execution is interrupted.

SGML
SGML stands for "Standard Generalized Markup Language". SGML is based on the idea that documents have structural and other semantic elements that can be described without reference to how such elements should be displayed. The actual display of such a document may vary depending on the output medium and style preferences. In structured texts SGML not only defines structures (in the DTD = Document Type Definition) but also ensures they are consistently used.
HTML is a specialized application of SGML. This means that most Web browsers support only a limited range of SGML standards and that almost all SGML-enabled systems can produce attractive HTML pages.

Special properties of a formatted field

rich text controlcontrols; rich text control
Allows you to use line breaks and formatting in a control field such as a text box or label. To manually enter a line break press the Enter key. Select "Multi-line with formatting" to enter formatted text.
If you select the text type "Multi-line with formatting" you cannot bind this control to a database field.
Here "field" is a data field from the list table "table" whose content is displayed in the list of the combo box.
Value lists for HTML documents
For HTML forms you can enter a value list under List content. Select the option "Valuelist" under Type of list contents. The values entered here will not be visible in the form and are used to assign values to the visible entries. The entries made under List content correspond to the HTML tag .
In the data transfer of a selected entry from a list box or a combo box both the list of the values displayed in the form which was entered on the General tab under List entries and the value list entered on the Data tab under List content are taken into consideration If a (non-empty) text is at the selected position in the value list () it will be transmitted. Otherwise the text displayed in the () control is sent.
If the value list is to contain an empty string enter the value "$$$empty$$$" under List content at the corresponding position (note uppercase/lowercase). $[officename] interprets this input as an empty string and assigns it to the respective list entry.
When sending a form all controls available in $[officename] are taken into consideration. The name of the control and the corresponding value if available are transmitted.
Which values are transmitted in each case depends on the respective control. For text fields the visible entries are transmitted; for list boxes the selected entries are transmitted; for check boxes and option fields the associated reference values are transmitted if these fields were activated.
How this information is transmitted depends on the selected transfer method (Get or Post) and the coding (URL or Multipart). If the Get method and URL encoding are selected for example value pairs in the form = are sent.
In addition to the controls that are recognized in HTML $[officename] offers other controls. It should be noted that for fields with a specific numerical format the visible values are not transmitted but rather fixed default formats. The following table shows how the data of the $[officename]-specific controls is transmitted
Value Pair
Event handling of controls is performed using the $[officename] API. If you assign an event to a control an object registers itself internally as a "Listener" for a specific control event. To do this the object must use a specific interface for example the XFocusListener Interface so that it can react to focus events. When the event occurs the control then invokes a special method of the Listener interface when the control receives the focus. The internally registered object then invokes the JavaScript or $[officename] Basic code which was assigned to the event.
The HTML filter now uses precisely these listener interfaces and method names so that it can import and export events as desired. You can register a focus event through
<INPUT TYPE=text ONFOCUS="/* code */"
rather than through the
<INPUT TYPE=text SDEvent-XFocusListener-focusGained="/* code */"

In this example you have a Linux computer with an HTTP server. The URL of your HTTP server is http//myserver.com and the output directory of your HTML documents is the //user/local/http/ directory. Your Perl scripts are contained in the //user/local/http/cgi-bin/ directory. Enter secret.htm as an export file name and presentation.htm as URL for listeners. In the URL for presentation text box enter http//myserver.com/presentation/ and for the URL for Perl scripts enter http//myserver.com/cgi-bin/.
Now copy all *.htm *.jpg and *.gif files from the directories that were specified during the export into the //user/local/http/presentation/ directory on your HTTP Server and copy all files with the *.pl and *.txt extensions into the //user/local/http/cgi-bin/ directory.
Login on your server as root and switch to the //user/local/http/cgi-bin/ directory. You can define the corresponding rights using the chmod command.

A "query" is a special view of a table. A query can display chosen records or chosen fields within records; it can also sort those records. A query can apply to one table or to multiple tables if they are linked by common data fields.
Use queries to find records from data tables based on certain criteria. All queries created for a database are listed under the Queries entry. Since this entry contains the database queries it is also called the "query container".
Printing Queries
The corresponding function in an SQL statement is
SELECT FUNCTION() AS alias FROM table
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM "Item"
In the following example a query is run through two tables an "Item" table with the "ItemNo" field and a "Suppliers" table with the "SupplierName" field. In addition both tables have a common field name "SupplierNo."
The following steps are required to create a query containing all suppliers who deliver more than three items.
Left Join
Right Join
Full Join
In a natural join the keyword NATURAL in inserted into the SQL statement that defines the relation. The relation joins all columns that have the same column name in both tables. The resulting joined table contains only one column for each pair of equally named columns.

Specifies that all external key fields will be deleted if you delete the corresponding primary key field.
When you delete a primary key field with the Delete cascade option all records from other tables that have this key as their foreign key are also deleted. Use this option with great care; it is possible that a major portion of the database can be deleted.
If you delete the corresponding primary key the "IS NULL" value will be assigned to all external key fields.
Set Default
If you delete the corresponding primary key a set value will be set to all external key fields.

The option will be set to off for new documents. For Writer documents created by a version prior to OpenOffice.org 2.0 the option is on.
Use OpenOffice.org 1.1 text wrapping around objects
Microsoft Word and Writer have different approaches on wrapping text around floating screen objects. Floating screen object are Writer frames and drawing objects and the objects 'text box' 'graphic' 'frame' 'picture' etc. in Microsoft Word.
Example If the range A1B1 is referenced in a formula and you insert a new column after column B the reference is expanded to A1C1. If the range A1B1 is referenced and a new row is inserted under row 1 the reference is not expanded since there is only a single cell in the vertical direction.
If you insert rows or columns in the middle of a reference area the reference is always expanded.

Conversion from text to number
How to treat text when encountered as operand in an arithmetic operation or as argument to a function that expects a number instead. Unambiguous conversion is possible for integer numbers including exponents and ISO 8601 dates and times in their extended formats with separators. Fractional numeric values with decimal separators or dates other than ISO 8601 are locale dependent. Note that in locale dependent conversions the resulting numeric value may differ between locales!
Treat empty string as zero
This option determines how an empty string is treated when used in arithmetic operations. If you have set "Conversion from text to number" to either "Generate #VALUE! error" or "Treat as zero" you cannot choose (here) if conversion of an empty string to a number will generate an error or if it will treat empty strings as zero. Otherwise this option determines how empty strings are treated.

The Curve icon Icon on the Drawing toolbar opens a toolbar to draw Bézier curves. Bézier curves are defined by a start point and an end point which are called "anchors". The curvature of the Bézier curve is defined by control points ("handles"). Moving a control point changes the shape of the Bézier curve.
Control points are only visible in "Edit Points" mode. Control points are represented by circles anchor points are represented by squares. The start point is a little bit larger than the other anchor points.
Bézier curve segments and straight line segments can be joined to form more complex Bézier curves. Three different transitions can be applied to join adjacent segments
A symmetrical anchor point has the same line curvature on either side and two control lines that move together as a straight line.
A smooth anchor point may have different line curvatures on either side.

Conditional styles are paragraph styles that have different properties depending on the context. Once defined you cannot change the conditional properties of a conditional style.
$[officename] applies the paragraph properties of conditional styles as follows (the bold terms correspond to the titles of dialog fields) If a paragraph formatted with a conditional style is in a Context that has an Applied Style linked to it then the Paragraph Style from that condition is used. If no style is linked to the Context then the attributes defined in the conditional style apply. The following example illustrates this relationship

Registration of ${PRODUCTNAME} as default application for Microsoft Office formats can be forced or suppressed by using the following command line switches with the installer
REGISTERALLMSOTYPES=1 will force registration of ${PRODUCTNAME} as default application for Microsoft Office formats.
REGISTERNOMSOTYPES=1 will suppress registration of ${PRODUCTNAME} as default application for Microsoft Office formats.
As a general rule you are recommended to install ${PRODUCTNAME} via the installation methods recommended by your particular Linux distribution (such as the Ubuntu Software Center in the case of Ubuntu Linux). This is because it is usually the simplest way to obtain an installation that is optimally integrated into your system. Indeed ${PRODUCTNAME} may well be already installed by default when you originally install your Linux operating system.
This "stand-alone" ${PRODUCTNAME} installer is provided for users in need of previews having special needs and for out-of-the-ordinary cases.

Thunderbird offers support for user privacy and remote image protection. To ensure a user’s privacy Thunderbird automatically blocks remote images in email messages.
Thunderbird protects you from email scams which try to trick users into handing over personal and confidential information by indicating when a message is a potential phishing attempt. As a second line of defense Thunderbird warns you when you click on a link which appears to be taking you to a different Web site than the one indicated by the URL in the message.
Thunderbird release notes are specific to each version of the application. Select your version from the list below to see the release notes for it.

We want the audio quality to reflect the audio quality a speech-to-text engine will see in the wild. Thus we want variety. This teaches the speech-to-text engine to handle various situations—background talking car noise fan noise—without errors.
We want the Common Voice dataset to reflect the audio quality a speech-to-text engine will hear in the wild so we’re looking for variety. In addition to a diverse community of speakers a dataset with varying audio quality will teach the speech-to-text engine to handle various real-world situations from background talking to car noise. As long as your voice clip is intelligible it should be good enough for the dataset.

This error means that the kernel driver was either not able to allocate enough memory or that some mapping operation failed.
The VirtualBox Linux kernel driver is either not loaded or not set up correctly. Please try setting it up again by executing  '/sbin/vboxconfig'as root.If your system has EFI Secure Boot enabled you may also need to sign the kernel modules (vboxdrv vboxnetflt vboxnetadp vboxpci) before you can load them. Please see your Linux system's documentation for more information.
The VirtualBox kernel modules do not match this version of VirtualBox. The installation of VirtualBox was apparently not successful. Executing  '/sbin/vboxconfig'may correct this. Make sure that you are not mixing builds of VirtualBox from different sources.

Publish - You can set the terms of publishing your topic in the Publish box. For Status Visibility and Publish (immediately) click on the Edit link to reveal more options. Visibility includes options for password-protecting a topic or making it stay at the top of your blog indefinitely (sticky). Publish (immediately) allows you to set a future or past date and time so you can schedule a topic to be published in the future or backdate a topic.
Topic Editor - Enter the text for your topic. There are two modes of editing Visual and HTML. Choose the mode by clicking on the appropriate tab. Visual mode gives you a WYSIWYG editor. Click the last icon in the row to get a second row of controls. The HTML mode allows you to enter raw HTML along with your topic text. You can insert media files by clicking the icons above the topic editor and following the directions. You can go to the distraction-free writing screen via the Fullscreen icon in Visual mode (second to last in the top row) or the Fullscreen button in HTML mode (last in the row). Once there you can make buttons visible by hovering over the top area. Exit Fullscreen back to the regular topic editor.
Title - Enter a title for your topic. After you enter a title you#8217;ll see the permalink below which you can edit.
Title and Topic Editor
The title field and the big topic editing Area are fixed in place but you can reposition all the other boxes using drag and drop and can minimize or expand them by clicking the title bar of each box. Use the Screen Options tab to unhide more boxes (Excerpt Send Trackbacks Custom Fields Discussion Slug Author) or to choose a 1- or 2-column layout for this screen.

The next screen for Network Setup will give you individually-generated lines of code to add to your wp-config.php and .htaccess files. Make sure the settings of your FTP client make files starting with a dot visible so that you can find .htaccess; you may have to create this file if it really is not there. Make backup copies of those two files.
Choose subdomains or subdirectories; this can only be switched afterwards by reconfiguring your installation. Fill out the network details and click Install. If this does not work you may have to add a wildcard DNS record (for subdomains) or change to another setting in Permalinks (for subdirectories).
To make your installation more secure you should also add
