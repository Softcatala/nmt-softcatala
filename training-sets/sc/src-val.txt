Manual Partitioning
In most other installers for both Linux and other operating systems disk partitioning usually takes a "bottom-up" approach. In these installers you first create underlying devices such as LVM physical volumes then you create a layout such as LVM on top of them then you create file systems on top of logical volumes and the last step is usually assigning a mount point to each volume as needed.
Installing Using Anaconda
If your system does not have the ability to use the graphical mode you can

Booting the PRODUCT; Installer
Press F12 to select boot device or Del to enter SETUP
Follow the on-screen instructions to access the boot menu. If no instructions are displayed (some systems only display a graphical logo during early stages of boot) try pressing F12 F11 F10 or Del several times; these are most commonly used keys. Note that there is usually a very short time window provided to access the menu; once it passes you need to restart the system and try again.
Some older systems may not support choosing a boot device at startup. In that case enter the system's SETUP (BIOS) and change the default boot order so that your boot media (CD DVD USB or network) have higher priority than internal hard drives.
When your system's boot menu opens select an entry such as Boot from USB if you created a bootable USB drive Boot from CD/DVD if you are using an optical disc to install PRODUCT; or Boot from PXE if you want to boot from a network location.
Create configuration data that allows a computer to boot PRODUCT;
Understand and interact with the PRODUCT; installation program
Complete basic post-installation configuration of a PRODUCT; system
This guide does not cover use of PRODUCT;. To learn how to use an installed PRODUCT; system see the other manuals available at Fedora Documentation.
This guide is intended for PRODUCT; users of all levels of experience. However it describes the installation process and its many options in far greater detail than most users are likely to require. You do not need to read and understand this entire document to install PRODUCT; on a computer. This document is most likely to help experienced users perform advanced and unusual installations.
If a link is greyed out it means that the installer is currently configuring this section and you must wait for the configuration to finish before accessing that screen. This typically happens when you change the installation source in the Installation Source screen and the installer is probing the new source location and gathering a list of available packages.
Screens with black text and no warning symbol mean that this screen does not require your attention. You can still change your settings in these screens but it is not necessary to do so to complete the installation. This typically happens with localization settings as these are either detected automatically or set up on the previous screen where you select your language and locale.
A warning message is displayed at the bottom of the summary screen and the Begin Installation button is greyed out as long as at least one item has not been configured yet.

This Fedora release includes basic support for the OpenCL standard which provides sufficient environment for the development of the OpenCL enabled software.
To enable OpenCL development the Mesa's OpenCL state-tracker the Portable Computing Language (pocl) and several other OpenCL packages have been added to the official Fedora repositories. The pocl language can be used on CPUs and Mesa can be used on R600 AMD/ATI GPUs.
Python 3.4
With this release Python 3 has been upgraded to version 3.4 which provides various bug fixes enhancements and security improvements over the previous version. For example several new library modules and features have been added and multiple library modules have been significantly improved.
Read the Python 3.4 Release Schedule and What’s New In Python 3.4 for details.
Read the Make release announcement at  for more information about the changes in this release. The project documentation is available at 
Review Board 2.0
Fedora now provides Review Board 2.0 a powerful web-based patch review and management tool.
Version 2.0 adds the ability to post committed changes from a branch directly from the web UI adds review of text file attachments greatly extends the capabilities of the public API and extension framework and offers significant performance improvements usability enhancements and visual cleanups.
Significant enhancements have been made to the diff viewer as well as adding support for reviews on non-code files (such as binary file formats).
Anaconda command line options are used when running the installer from a terminal within an already installed system as for example when installing into a disk image.
The built-in help available through the anaconda -h command now provides descriptions for all available commands.
--memcheck Check if the system has sufficient RAM to complete the installation and abort the installation if it does not. This check is approximate. Memory usage during installation depends on the package selection user interface (graphical/text) and other parameters.
--nomemcheck Do not check if the system has enough memory to complete the installation.
--leavebootorder Boot drives in their existing order - used to override the default of booting into the newly installed drive on IBM Power Systems servers and EFI systems. This is useful for systems that for example should network boot first before falling back to a local boot.

First download one of the available BFO specific images. You have a choice of ISO (DVD/CD) USB Floppy and lkrn images. Then write that image to an appropriate medium.  Next boot from that medium.  After that you're using BFO!  Use your keyboard to select menus to run diagnostics or boot a Fedora installer or rescue mode.
Can I use it with grub?
Yes!  Just run the following commands as root
How does it work?
BFO was started by boot.kernel.org (BKO) and combines a series of recent technologies to produce a new boot stack.  The glue that holds everything together is ipxe.  Users familiar with pxe will find ipxe very familiar.  Latest versions support several protocols beyond just tftp.  We are using http to transfer files around.  The basic steps are as follows

Available images and instructions
Fedora for ARM includes two image types–one for use with platforms requiring a VFAT partition (BeagleBone Black) the other for use with devices that boot from an EXT partition (Trimslice). For each of these there are a number of desktop choices including MATE KDE Xfce LXDE SOAS and a minimal image that does not include the desktop. Any of these images can be used with QEMU.
All images are ARMv7 32bit specific.

Here's the three links to libraries of openly-licensed assets that I use quite often
Open Clip Art Library - a vast library of SVG-format public-domain artwork. The quality varies widely but there's a ton of great treasures in there.
CompFight - CompFight is a search engine that queries Flickr for Creative Commons licensed photography.
>Open Font Library - a sister site to Open Clip Art Library the OFL has a ton of openly-licensed fonts. I also have an ongoing blog series where I highlight particular openly-licensed fonts I like to use.
Ooh I have a great one in mind. So my laptop is actually a tablet as well. Sometimes when I'm taking notes in tablet mode it's too inconvenient to flip it over into keyboard/laptop mode. So there's this app called CellWriter that does text recognition so I can write in the CellWriter pane and it automatically converts my scribbling into real text. It's a very nice tool that many Linux users seem to be unaware of!
Daily workflow
Here's a daily workflow you can use to make this system work!
At the beginning of the day create a new note and put the date in it. E.g the naming format I like to use is "To Do 8 Nov 2010."
Open up your "Master To-Do List" note and pick one or two items you think you can accomplish today. Copy them into today's To Do note.
Open up your "Waiting On To-Do List" note and pick one or two items you think you could follow up on today. If Joe's had that proposal on his desk for two weeks now might be a good time to remind him that you're waiting for him to review it!

How do I turn the Live image into bootable media?
After you download the image you will make bootable media from it. Either burn the image to a blank DVD disc or write the image to a USB flash drive.
How do I boot from the media?
Consult your computer system's documentation for the procedure to boot from media other than the built-in hard disk. The process may differ based on the manufacturer and model of your computer. You may find these common tips useful.

Slide

You can drag and drop many things in GIMP. For example dragging a color from the toolbox or from a color palette and dropping it into an image will fill the current selection with that color.
You can use the middle mouse button to pan around the image (or optionally hold Spacebar while you move the mouse).
Click and drag on a ruler to place a guide on an image. All dragged selections will snap to the guides. You can remove guides by dragging them off the image with the Move tool.
You can drag a layer from the Layers dialog and drop it onto the toolbox. This will create a new image containing only that layer.
A floating selection must be anchored to a new layer or to the last active layer before doing other operations on the image. Click on the quot;New Layerquot; or the quot;Anchor Layerquot; button in the Layers dialog or use the menus to do the same.

Version 2.0
First a statistic the GIMP code base contains about 230000 lines of C code and most of these lines were rewritten in the evolution from 1.2 to 2.0. From the user's point of view however GIMP 2 is fundamentally similar to GIMP 1; the features are similar enough that GIMP 1 users won't be lost. As part of the restructuring work the developers cleaned up the code greatly an investment that while not directly visible to the user will ease maintenance and make future additions less painful. Thus the GIMP 2 code base is significantly better organized and more maintainable than was the case for GIMP 1.2.
Basic tools
The basic tools in GIMP 2 are not very different from their predecessors in GIMP 1. The Select Regions by Color tool is now shown in the GIMP toolbox but was already included in GIMP 1 as a menu option in the Select menu. The Transform tool has been divided into several specialized tools Rotation Scale Shearing and Perspective. Color operations are now associated with layers in the menu LayerColors but this is merely a cleanup they were already present in the Image menu (illogically since they are layer operations). Thus no completely new tools appear in this release but two of the tools have been totally revamped compared to the older versions the Text tool and the Path tool. More on this below.
The user interface for tools has also changed significantly. The Tool Options dialog box was modified to not resize itself when a new tool is chosen. Most users felt that the window changing size when a new tool was selected was annoying. Now by default the Tool Options dialog is constantly open and docked under the toolbox where it can easily be found.
GIMP version 1.2.0 was released on December 25 2000. Compared to the version 1.0 it included mostly fixes and improvements of the user interface.

Color management in GIMP 2.4
New Crop Tool
Just like the selection tools the new crop tool has been enhanced since the last release. The resize handles actually resize the crop rectangle instead of providing both resize and move functionality. The tool behaves more naturally and consistently with other GIMP tools. For details see .
To move simply drag the rectangle clicking within the area. Resizing is possible in one or two axes at the same time dragging the handle-bars on the sides and corners. The outside area is darkened with a nice passepartout effect to better get the idea of how the final crop will look like.
This option is enabled only if a path exists. When your text is created then create or import a path and make it active. If you create your path before the text the path becomes invisible and you have to make it visible in the Path Dialog.
This command is also available from the Layer menu
The Text along Path command among text commands in the Layer menu
This group of options appears only if a text layer exists.
Click on the Text along Path button. The text is bent along the path. Letters are represented with their outline. Each of them is a component of the new path that appears in the Path dialog. All path options should apply to this new path.
An alpha channel encodes information about how transparent a layer is at each pixel. It is visible in the Channel Dialog white is complete opacity black is complete transparency and grey levels are partial transparencies.
The background layer is particular. If you have just created a new image it has still only one layer which is a background layer. If the image has been created with an opaque Fill type this one layer has no Alpha channel. To get a background layer with transparency either you create your new image with a transparent Fill type or you use the Add an Alpha Channel.
If you add a new layer even with an opaque Fill type an Alpha channel is automatically added to the layer.
Every layer other than the bottom layer of an image has automatically an Alpha channel but you can't see a grayscale representation of the alpha values. See Alpha in Glossary for more information.
Example for Alpha channel
Drag and drop a file onto the GIMP Toolbox to open the file. Drag an image into an open GIMP image to add dropped file as a new layer or set of layers to the already open image.
Many applications support dragging and dropping an image into GIMP; for example drag an image from Firefox and drop it onto GIMP's toolbox.
Copy and Paste
Use FileCreateFrom Clipboard to create a new image from the clipboard; alternatively you can use EditPaste asNew Image. Many applications support copying an image to the clipboard that can then be pasted into GIMP. Many operating systems support copying screens to the clipboard. Print Screen typically copies the screen to the clipboard and AltPrint Screen copies only the active window. Print screen is not universally supported and just because your operating system can copy an image to the clipboard does not mean that GIMP can use the image from the clipboard. Your best bet is to try it and see if it works.

$$E = 255 - \frac{(255-M)\times (255-I)}{255}$$
Example for layer mode Overlay
Overlay mode inverts the pixel value of the lower layer multiplies it by two times the pixel value of the upper layer adds that to the original pixel value of the lower layer divides by 255 and then multiplies by the pixel value of the original lower layer and divides by 255 again. It darkens the image but not as much as with Multiply mode.
The equation is the *theoretical* equation. Due to  Bug #162395  the actual equation is equivalent to Soft light. It is difficult to fix this bug without changing the appearance of existing images.
The equation is 
In a grayscale image each point is represented by a brightness value ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white) with intermediate values representing different levels of gray.
Components of the RGB and CMY Color Model
In the RGB Color Model mixing Red Green and Blue gives White which is what happens on your screen.
In the CMY(K) color model mixing Cyan Magenta and Yellow gives Black which is what happens when you print on a white paper. The printer will actually use the black cartridge for economical reasons and better color rendering.
Conceptually the difference between a grayscale image and an RGB image is the number of color channels a grayscale image has one; an RGB image has three. An RGB image can be thought of as three superimposed grayscale images one colored red one green and one blue.

Tab menu
A dialog in a dock with the Tab menu button highlighted.
In each dialog you can access a special menu of tab-related operations by pressing the Tab Menu button as highlighted in the figure above. Exactly which commands are shown in the menu depends on the active dialog but they always include operations for creating new tabs closing or detaching tabs.
The Tab menu of the Layers dialog.
The Tab menu gives you access to the following commands
Undo is performed on an image-specific basis the "Undo History" is one of the components of an image. GIMP allocates a certain amount of memory to each image for this purpose. You can customize your Preferences to increase or decrease the amount using the System Resources page of the Preferences dialog. There are two important variables the minimal number of undo levels which GIMP will maintain regardless of how much memory they consume and the maximum undo memory beyond which GIMP will begin to delete the oldest items from the Undo History.
Even though the Undo History is a component of an image it is not saved when you save the image using GIMP's native XCF format which preserves every other image property. When the image is reopened it will have an empty Undo History.
GIMP's implementation of Undo is rather sophisticated. Many operations require very little Undo memory (e.g. changing visibility of a layer) so you can perform long sequences of them before they drop out of the Undo History. Some operations such as changing layer visibility are compressed so that doing them several times in a row produces only a single point in the Undo History. However there are other operations that may consume a lot of undo memory. Most filters are implemented by plug-ins so the GIMP core has no efficient way of knowing what changed. As such there is no way to implement Undo except by memorizing the entire contents of the affected layer before and after the operation. You might only be able to perform a few such operations before they drop out of the Undo History.
Things That Cannot be Undone
Most actions that alter an image can be undone. Actions that do not alter the image generally cannot be undone. Examples include saving the image to a file duplicating the image copying part of the image to the clipboard etc. It also includes most actions that affect the image display without altering the underlying image data. The most important example is zooming. There are however exceptions toggling QuickMask on or off can be undone even though it does not alter the image data.
You can also move a layer group to the canvas this duplicates the group in the group. Chain all layers in the duplicated layer group activate the Move tool then in the image move the layer. That's a way to multiply multi-layer objects in an image.
Delete a Layer Group
To delete a layer group click on the red cross button at the bottom of the layer dialog or right-click and select  Delete layer.
Embed Layer Groups
When a layer group is activated you can add another group inside it with the Add New Layer Group command. There seems to be no limit excepted memory to the number of embedded layer groups.
To choose the color of your logo just click on the color button. This brings up a color dialog.

Make Buttons
Button
Under this headline you'll find two scripts that makes rectangular beveled buttons with or without round corners (Round Button or Simple Beveled Button). They have a dozen parameters or so and most of them are similar to those in the logo scripts. You can experiment with different settings to come up with a button you like.
Click and drag the pointer across the histogram display area from the lowest level to the highest level of the range you want.
Click and drag the black or white triangles on the slider below the histogram.
Use the spinbutton entries below the slider (left entry bottom of range; right entry top of range).
At the bottom of the dialog some basic statistics are shown describing the distribution of channel values restricted to the selected range
Mean  the mean value of the interval in the selected channel.
Please keep in mind that every Pixel of an image is stored in the memory. If you're creating large files with a high density of pixels GIMP will need some time for every function you're applying to the image.
Portrait/Landscape buttons
These buttons toggle between Portrait and Landscape mode. Concretely their effect is to exchange the values for Width and Height. If the X and Y resolutions are different (in Advanced Options) then these values are exchanged also. On the right image size image resolution and color space are displayed.
The Advanced Options dialog
These are options that will mainly be of interest to more advanced users.
Example for Locking Alpha Channel
The active layer has three horizontal opaque green stripes on a transparent background. We paint a vertical red stripe. Lock unchecked Opaque and transparent areas of the active layer are painted with red.
Lock checked Only opaque areas of the active layer are painted with red. Transparent areas are preserved.
If a layer name in the Layer Dialog is in bold then this layer has no Alpha channel.
Layer management
Selected pixels only As the name says pixels are picked from the selected area only in the active layer or all visible layers according to the status of the previous option.
You can give a name to the new palette here. If the name you choose is already used by an existing palette a unique name will be formed by appending a number (e. g. "#1").
Here you specify the number of colors in the palette. The default is 256 chosen for three reasons (1) every gradient contains 256 distinct colors; (2) GIF files can use a maximum of 256 colors; (3) GIMP indexed images can contain a maximum of 256 distinct colors. You can use any number you like here though GIMP will try to create a palette by spacing the specified number of colors even across the color range of the gradient or image.
Here you specify the number of columns for the palette. This only affects the way the palette is displayed and has no effect on the way the palette is used.
Even setting Number of colors to maximum the number of colors can't exceed 10000 in the palette. RGB images have much more colors. Interval should allow to group similar colors around an average and so get a better palette. This problem doesn't exist with 256 colors indexed images Interval to 1 allows picking 256 colors (this option is grayed out with more than 256 colors indexed palettes too).

Watercolor Color Selector
This color selector is symbolized by a brush. The function mode of this selector is a little different from that of models presented so far. The principle consists in changing the current foreground color by clicking in the rectangular palette. If the current foreground color is for example white then it turns to reddish by clicking in the red color area. Repeated clicking strengthens the effect. With the slider which is right apart from the color palette you can set the color quantity per every mouse click. The higher the sliding control is the more color is taken up per click.
Palette Color Selector
This color selector brings up a list of the colors of the current palette in the Palettes dialog . You can set GIMP's foreground or background colors by clicking on colors in the colors display. You can also use the arrow keys to move within the list of colors.

The Frosty logo
This filter is derived from the Frosty logo script (FileCreateLogosFrosty in the image window) which creates a frozen logo like the example above.
The filter adds this frosty effect to the alpha that is the area of the active layer defined by the non-transparent pixels (think of it as a selection by visibility). The filter effect will always be applied according to the alpha values.
Unlike the most alpha to logo filters the Frosty filter will not resize the image to the active layer's size.

Number of starting points for spikes (0-16). It's the number of big spikes. There is the same number of small spikes. When number is odd small spikes are opposite the big ones. When number is even big spikes are opposite another big spike.
Spike angle
This is angle of first big spike with horizontal (-1 +360). -1 determines this value at random. If a spot has several pixels within required threshold each of them will generate a sparkle. If angle is positive they will all be superimposed. With -1 each sparkle will have a random rotation resulting in numerous thin spikes.
This option determines the number of sparkles on your image. It indicates the percentage (0.0-1.0) of all possible sparkles that will be preserved.
When you increase transparency (0.0-1.0) sparkles become more transparent and the layer beneath becomes visible. If there is no other layer sparkle saturation decreases.
This filter simulates the effect you get when you light up a wall with a spot. It doesn't produce any drop shadows and of course doesn't reveal any new details in dark zones.

So were the results rounded to the nearest integer and then the pixels were displaced by a whole-numbered amount? No. Every pixel is displaced exactly by the calculated amount; a displacement by a fractional amount is realized by interpolation. A closer look at the example image will show it

Example of applying the RGB Noise filter
Filter RGB Noise applied
The RGB Noise filter adds a normally distributed noise to a layer or a selection. It uses the RGB color model to produce the noise (noise is added to red green and blue values of each pixel). A normal distribution means that only slight noise is added to the most pixels in the affected area while less pixels are affected by more extreme values. (If you apply this filter to an image filled with a solid grey color and then look at its histogram you will see a classic bell-shaped Gaussian curve.)
The result is very naturally looking noise.
This filter does not work with indexed images.

Changes the color of the currently selected fractal component (default is the foreground color in the toolbox) to a color of your choice.
Like the Simple color transformation but this time you can manage the color transformation for each color channel and for the alpha channel (shown as a black channel).
When you have many fractals with different colors the colors blend into each other. So even if you set pure red for a fractal it might actually be quite blue in some places while another red  fractal might have a lot of yellow in it. Scale Hue/Value changes the color strength of the active fractal or how influential that fractal color should be.
Determines influence or total impact of a certain fractal.
With the Flame filter you can create stunning randomly generated fractal patterns. You can't control the fractals as you can with the IFS Fractal filter but you can steer the random generator in a certain direction and choose from variations of a theme you like.
Unfortunately it turned out that this filter is not working properly for large images. Even more unfortunate is that its developer is currently not undertaking any actions with that plug-in at all so there seems no quick fix in sight. Although we can't give you the exact numbers the plug-in worked in a quick test for a 1024x768 pixel image but didn't do it for a 2500x2500 pixel image.
This plug-in was given to GIMP by Scott Draves in 1997. He also holds the copyright for the plug-in. An descriptive page for the plug-in provided by the author can be found in the internet .

The basic operations provided by the clipboard are Cut Copy and Paste. Cut means that the item is removed from the document and copied to the clipboard. Copy leaves the item in the document and copies it to the clipboard. Paste copies the contents of the clipboard to the document. The GIMP makes an intelligent decision about what to paste depending upon the target. If the target is a canvas the Paste operation uses the image clipboard. If the target is a text entry box the paste operation uses the text clipboard.
On the one hand  light comes from the sun or other radiant sources and is  refractedby mediums (water the atmosphere glass) and diffusely  or  specularly reflected by surfaces.
On the other hand color isn't out there in the world in the same tangible way that light is. Rather color is part of how we sense the world around us. Light enters the eyes is processed by light receptors (cones and rods) and sent via the optic nerves to the brain for further processing and interpretation.
Light varies in wavelengths which our eyes and brain interpret as varying hues (reds blues greens and so on) and also in intensity (aka "luminance"). So our perception of color is composed of both intensity ("luminance") information and chromaticity information.
The naming of colors  carries one out of the narrow realm of color perception and into the larger realm of cultural and linguistic interpretation and classification of color and thence into even larger philosophical aesthetic theological and metaphysical considerations.
See also the Indexed Palette section and the Convert Image to Indexed Colors command.
Interpolation means calculating intermediate values. When you enlarge (digitally zoom) or otherwise transform (rotate shear or give perspective to) a digital image interpolation procedures are used to compute the colors of the pixels in the transformed image. GIMP offers three interpolation methods which differ in quality and speed. In general the better the quality the more time the interpolation takes (see Interpolation methods).
GIMP uses interpolation when you Scale an image Scale a layer and when you Transform an image.
IPTC is an acronym for International Press Telecommunications Council which developed the Information Interchange Model (IIM) for text image and other media types metadata. Refer to .
JPEG is a file format which supports compression and works at all color depths. The image compression is adjustable but beware Too high a compression could severely reduce image quality since JPEG compression is lossy.
This term often refers to the light intensity the luminosity of a color. It varies from 0 (black) to 100 (full light).

XCF is a file format which is special because it is GIMP's native file format that is it was designed specifically to store all of the data that goes to make up a GIMP image. Because of this XCF files may be quite complicated and there are few programs other than GIMP that can read them.
When an image is stored as an XCF file the file encodes nearly everything there is to know about the image the pixel data for each of the layers the current selection additional channels if there are any paths if there are any and guides. The most important thing that is not saved in an XCF file is the undo history.
The pixel data in an XCF file is represented in a lossless compressed form the image byte blocks are compressed using the lossless RLE algorithm. This means that no matter how many times you load and save an image using this format not a single pixel or other image data is lost or modified because of this format. XCF files can become very large however GIMP allows you to compress the files themselves using either the gzip or bzip2 compression methods both of which are fast efficient and freely available. Compressing an XCF file will often shrink it by a factor of 10 or more.
The Seamless Clone tool is aimed to simplify making layered compositions. Typically when you paste one image into another there are all sorts of mismatches color temperature brightness etc. This new experimental tool tries to adapt various properties of a pasted image with regards to its backdrop.
To enable these tools you need to first enable the Playground page of the Preferences dialog. Do it by running GIMP with a --show-playground switch (for Windows you might want tweaking the path to GIMP in the shortcut properties accordingly). Then you need to go to EditPreferencesPlayground and enable the respective options so that the tools would show up in the toolbox.
We need to stress again that you should only do so either if you are very curious or (which we hope for) intend to help us fix them.

The Help Menu
These new buttons in GIMP-2.10 allow you to switch between linear and perceptual (non-linear) modes.
Linear and Logarithmic buttons
These buttons allow to choose the Linear or Logarithmic type of the histogram. You can also use the same options in Tool Options dialog. This grayed out histogram is not displayed by default.
Main Editing Area
The horizontal gradient it represents the input tonal scale. It too ranges from 0 (black) to 255 (white) from Shadows to Highlights. When you adjust the curve it splits up into two parts; the upper part then represents the tonal balance of the layer or selection.
Hue changes are shown in color swatches and the result is visible in the image if the Preview option is enabled.
This slider lets you set how much color ranges will overlap. This effect is very subtle and works on very next colors only
Example for the Overlap option
Original image. From the left to the right a reddish yellow (255;240;0); a pure yellow (255;255;0); a greenish yellow (240;255;0).
Overlap = 0. Hue = 15. Colors become (186;255;1) (168;255;1) (156;255;1).
The gray slider determines the mid point. Going to the left to the black makes the image lighter (more colored / more opaque) . Going to the right to the white makes the image darker (less colored / more transparent).
Two eye-droppers when you click them the mouse pointer becomes an eye-dropper. Then clicking on the image determines the black or the white point according to the chosen eye-dropper. Use the left dark one  to determine the black-point; use the right white one  to determine the white point.
Three numeric text boxes to enter values directly.
Input Levels are used to lighten highlights (bright tones) darken shadows (dark tones) change the balance of bright and dark tones. Move sliders to the left to increase lightness (increase the chosen color / increase opacity). Move the sliders to the right to lessen lightness (lessen the chosen color / lessen opacity).
Examples for Input Levels
Clicking on the color swatch provides a color selection dialog where you can select a color. You can also select a color using the eye dropper on the right.
Color to alpha comes with a GEGL option dialog under Toolbox. When the Sample merged option is unchecked color picker picks only one pixel color. When the option is checked mouse pointer goes with a square limiting a pixel sample that determines a merged sample color. You can fix square size directly in text box or using arrow heads or Up and Down keyboard keys.
Right clicking on the color swatch will display a menu where you can select Foreground or Background colors White or Black.
Transparency and Opacity thresholds
Transparency the limit below which colors become transparent.
Stretch Contrast Example
The layer and its Red Green and Blue histograms before Stretch Contrast.
The layer and its Red and Green and Blue histograms after Stretch Contrast. The pixel columns do not reach the right end of the histogram (255) because of a few very bright pixels unlike White Balance.
Histogram stretching creates gaps between the pixel columns giving it a stripped look.

Before filling
The Fill with Pattern command fills the image's selection with the pattern shown in the Brush/Pattern/Gradient area of the Toolbox. (The pattern is also shown to the left of the menu entry.) If some areas of the image are only partially selected (for example as a result of feathering the selection) they are filled in proportion to how much they are selected.
You can select another pattern by using the Pattern Dialog.

The mouse pointer becomes a cross. Click in the image window you want to capture. A new image is created. If the Include window decoration option is unchecked the title bar and the blue frame around the image will be removed.
This is useful if you want to capture a pop menu. A delay is then necessary so that you have time to pull the pop menu down.
If the Include mouse pointer option is checked then the mouse pointer and its coming with icon are also captured. The mouse pointer is captured in a separate layer. So you can move it to another place in the image.

The Set Image Canvas Size dialog
You can set the Width and the Height of the canvas. The default units are pixels but you can choose different units e.g. percent if you want to set the new dimensions relative to the current dimensions. If the Chain to the right of the Width and Height is not broken both Width and Height keep the same relative size to each other. That is if you change one of the values the other one also changes a corresponding amount. If you break the Chain by clicking on it you can set Width and Height separately.
Whatever units you use information about the size in pixels and the current resolution are always displayed below the Width and Height fields. You cannot change the resolution in the Canvas Size dialog; if you want to do that use the Print Size dialog.
The Offset values are used to place the image (the image not the active layer) on the canvas. You can see the size and the content of the canvas in the preview of the dialog window. When the canvas is smaller than the image the preview window shows it in a frame with a thin negative border.

Flip vertically (layer)
The Flip Vertically command reverses the active layer vertically that is from top to bottom. It leaves the dimensions of the layer and the pixel information unchanged.
You can access this command from the image menubar through LayerTransformFlip Vertically.
Description of the New Layer Dialog
The New Layer dialog
Under the title Create a new layer you can see the name of the image for that you create this new layer and next to the title a thumbnail of it. That is interesting to see if you have selected the good image when there is more than one image open.
The name of the new layer. It does not have any functional significance; it is simply a convenient way for you to remember the purpose of the layer. The default name is New Layer. If a layer with the name you choose already exists a number is automatically appended to it to make it unique (e.g. New Layer#1) when you click on the OK button.
If you click on one of these color buttons the "Eye" icon box of the created layer will have this color. This is interesting when you have many layers in the image.
After applying Autocrop Layer the active layer up has been cropped to the size of the circle it contains. Its size is reduced and the unoccupied part in the canvas is transparent revealing the yellow and green colors of the underlying layer.
As soon as you create a layer mask it acts on the image. The Disable Layer Mask command allows you to suspend this action. When you click on the menu entry a check is displayed next to it and the border of the layer mask's thumbnail in the Layers Dialog turns red.
You can access this command from the image menubar through LayerMaskDisable Layer Mask
or by holding down the Ctrl key (CtrlAlt on some systems) and single-clicking on the layer mask's thumbnail in the Layers Dialog.
You can undo this action by unchecking the menu entry in the LayerMask menu or by Ctrl-clicking (or CtrlAlt -clicking) again on the layer mask's thumbnail.
Add non-transparent areas to selection
The Add to Selection command creates a selection in the current layer from the Alpha Channel. Opaque pixels are fully selected transparent pixels are unselected and translucent pixels are partially selected. This selection is added to the existing selection. The alpha channel itself is not changed.
The other commands in this group of operations are similar except that instead of adding to the existing selection with the selection produced from the active layer they either completely replace the selection with a selection produced from the alpha selection subtract the alpha selection from the existing selection or create a selection that is the intersection of the two.
You can access this command from the image menubar through LayerTransparencyAdd to Selection.
Applying Add to Selection
Rounded rectangle
Example of using Rounded rectangle on a selection
An image with a selection
After Rounded rectangle
The Rounded Rectangle Script-Fu command converts an existing selection (rectangular elliptical or other shape) into a rectangular selection with rounded corners. The corners can be curved toward the inside (concave) or toward the outside (convex). To do this the command adds or removes circles at the corners of the selection.
By click-and-dragging a selection while pressing the CtrlAlt keys (see ) you also automatically create a floating selection.
Anchor a Floating Selection
You can anchor a floating selection in various ways
You can anchor the floating selection to the current layer the selection is originating from. To do this click anywhere on the image except on the floating selection. This merges the floating selection with the current layer.
Or you can use the Anchor layer command (CtrlH).

the Paint Dynamics selection dialog by clicking either the Edit Dynamics button or the Create a New Dynamics button.
You select the desired behaviors by clicking in the small squares. Clicking a second time will unselect the marking.
If you clone from a pattern the pattern is tiled; that is when the point you are copying from moves past one of the edges it jumps to the opposite edge and continues as though the pattern were repeated side-by-side indefinitely. When you clone from an image this does not happen if you go beyond the edges of the source the Clone tool stops producing any changes.
You can clone from any drawable (that is any layer layer mask or channel) to any other drawable. You can even clone to or from the selection mask by switching to QuickMask mode. If this means copying colors that the target does not support (for example cloning from an RGB layer to an Indexed layer or a layer mask) then the colors will be converted to the closest possible approximations.

Square-shaped gradient examples
There are four shapes that are some variant on a square Square Shaped (angular) Shaped (spherical) and Shaped (dimpled). They all put the foreground color at the center of a square whose center is at the start of the drawn line and whose half-diagonal is the length of the drawn line.

Rotating paths
Paths dialog
Option modus Path
When the path is drawn go to the path dialog and click on the first field before the path outline in the dialog window to get the eye icon visible. Then choose the transformation tool and in the upper part of the option dialog click on the path icon to tell the tool to act on the path.
When you pull a guide from a ruler the Move tool is automatically activated. That's not the case after using another tool and you have to activate it by yourself. When the mouse pointer goes over a guide this guide turns to red and you can click-and-drag to move it.
Moving a path
The Path Tool dialog has its own moving function see . But you can also use the Move Tool. The Move Mode must be set to Path. Note that the path becomes invisible; make it visible in the Path Dialog. You can choose the path to be moved or move the active path.
Moving a text
Every text has its own layer and can be moved as layers. See .
Swirl example
Swirling clockwise the whole image (brush size = image size) with a circular movement of the brush.

This offset can be positive or negative and is expressed in pixels. Distribute add it to the left edges horizontal centers right edges top edges vertical centers or bottoms of sources.
Example for the Distribute commands
Base image three layers. (Distribute right edges of targets) will be used.
Active layer is yellow (target). Offset = 0 all layers are aligned on the the right edge of the yellow layer.
Active layer is yellow. Offset = 10
Click on one corner of the desired crop area and drag your mouse to create the crop rectangle. You don't have to be accurate as you can change the exact shape of the rectangle later.
Dialog for Cropping
After completing the click and drag motion a rectangle with special regions is shown on the canvas. As the cursor is moved over the different areas of the selected crop area the cursor changes. You can then drag the rectangle's corners or edges to change the dimensions of the selected area. As shown in the figure above as the crop area is resized the dimensions and ratio are shown in the status bar. Double-click inside the rectangle or press Enter to complete cropping. See  for more information on cropping in GIMP.
If you would like to crop the image in a specific aspect ratio such as a square make sure the tool options are visible ( WindowsDockable DialogsTool Options). In the Tool Options dockable check the mark next to Fixed and make sure the drop-down box next to it is set to Aspect Ratio. You can now type the desired aspect ratio on the text box below such as 11.
You also have controls to change the aspect from landscape to portrait. After you set the aspect ratio drag one of the corners of the crop rectangle to update it. The rectangle changes to the chosen ratio and when you drag it should maintain that ratio.
The .gbr ("gimp brush") format is used for ordinary and color brushes. You can convert many other types of images including many brushes used by other programs into GIMP brushes by opening them in GIMP and saving them with file names ending in .gbr. This brings up a dialog box in which you can set the default Spacing for the brush. A more complete description of the GBR file format can be found in the file gbr.txt in the devel-docs directory of the GIMP source distribution.
Save a .gbr brush
GIH
The .gih ("gimp image hose") format is used for animated brushes. These brushes are constructed from images containing multiple layers each layer may contain multiple brush-shapes arranged in a grid. When you save an image as a .gih file a dialog comes up that allows you to describe the format of the brush. Look at The GIH dialog box for more information about the dialog. The GIH format is rather complicated a complete description can be found in the file gih.txt in the devel-docs directory of the GIMP source distribution.
VBR
CCITT Group 3 fax; CCITT Group 4 fax is a black and white format developed to transfer images by FAX.
These options can only be selected if the image is in indexed mode and reduced to two colors. Use ImageModeIndexed to convert the image to indexed. Be certain to check Use black and white (1-bit) palette.
With this option the color values are saved even if the pixels are completely transparent.
In this text box you can enter a comment that is associated with the image.
Export Image as MNG
The value returned when the script is invoked is the number of the chosen option where the option first is counted as 0.
SF-ENUM
It will create a widget in the control dialog. The widget is a combo-box showing all enum values for the given enum type. This has to be the name of a registered enum without the "Gimp" prefix. The second parameter speficies the default value using the enum value's nick.
SF-ENUM "Interpolation" '("InterpolationType" "linear")
The value returned when the script is invoked corresponds to chosen enum value.
(+ 3 (5 6) 7)
However this is incorrect mdash; remember every statement in Scheme starts and ends with parens so the Scheme interpreter will think that you're trying to call a function named 5 in the second group of parens rather than summing those numbers before adding them to 3.
The correct way to write the above statement would be
(+ 3 (+ 5 6) 7)
Make Sure You Have The Proper Spacing Too
Do you not need to stop and catch your breath? No? Well then let's proceed with your fourth lesson mdash; your first Script-Fu Script.
Creating A Text Box Script
One of the most common operations I perform in GIMP is creating a box with some text in it for a web page a logo or whatever. However you never quite know how big to make the initial image when you start out. You don't know how much space the text will fill with the font and font size you want.
The Script-Fu Master (and student) will quickly realize that this problem can easily be solved and automated with Script-Fu.
We will therefore create a script called Text Box which creates an image correctly sized to fit snugly around a line of text the user inputs. We'll also let the user choose the font font size and text color.
This script could easily be used in other scripts that work with text. Let's extend it so that it returns the image and the layers so other scripts can call this script and use the image and layers we create.
Modifying The Parameters And The Registration Function
To let the user specify the amount of buffer we'll add a parameter to our function and the registration function
Adding The New Code
We're going to add code in two places right before we resize the image and at the end of the script (to return the new image the layer and the text).
Another tool looking very much as the clone tool but smarter is the healing tool which also takes the area around the destination into account when cloning. A typical usage is removal of wrinkles and other minor errors in images.
In some cases you may be able to get good results by simply cutting out the offending object from the image and then using a plug-in called Resynthesizer to fill in the void. This plug-in is not included with the main GIMP distribution but it can be obtained from the author's web site . As with many things your mileage may vary.
Removing Red-eye
Red-eyes
When you take a flash picture of somebody who is looking directly toward the camera the iris of the eye can bounce the light of the flash back toward the camera in such a way as to make the eye appear bright red this effect is called red eye and looks very bizarre. Many modern cameras have special flash modes that minimize red-eye but they only work if you use them and even then they don't always work perfectly. Interestingly the same effect occurs with animals but the eyes may show up as other colors such as green.
Using QuickMask Mode
Using Quick Mask
Activate QuickMask mode using the left-bottom button in the image window. If a selection is present the mask is initialized with the content of the selection.
Choose any drawing tool. Paint on the QuickMask with black to remove selected areas and paint with white to add selected areas. Use grey colors to partially select areas.
You can also use selection tools and fill these selections with the Bucket Fill tool; this does not destroy the QuickMask selections!
That's the number of cells (one cell per aspect) that will be cut in every layer. Default is the number of layers as there is only one layer per aspect.
This tells how cells have been arranged in layers. If for example you have placed height cells at the rate of two cells per layer on four layers GIMP will display 1 rows of 2 columns on each layer.
Dimension Ranks Selection
There things are getting complicated! Explanations are necessary to understand how to arrange cell and layers.
GIMP starts retrieving cells from each layer and stacks them into a FIFO stack (First In First Out the first in is at the top of the stack and so can be first out). In our example 4 layers with 2 cells in each we'll have from top to bottom first cell of first layer second cell of first layer first cell of second layer second cell of second layer second cell of fourth layer. With one cell per layer or with several cells per layer result is the same. You can see this stack in the Layer Dialog of the resulting .gih image file.

Varying brush size
From GIMP-2.4 all brushes have a variable size.
How to vary the height of a brush
Using this option you can decide how the GIMP color management operates. There are three modes you can choose from
No color management choosing this selection shuts down the color management in GIMP completely.
Color managed display with this selection you can enable the GIMP color management to provide a fully corrected display of the images according to the given color profile for the display.
Soft-proofing when choosing this option you enable the GIMP color management not only to apply the profile for the display but also the selected printer simulation profile. Doing so you can preview the color results of a print with that printer.
Please note that the GIMP color management is used to enhance the display of images and the embedding of profiles to image files only. Especially are the options you choose in this dialog in no way used for printing from within GIMP. This is because the printing is a special task done by a more specialized printing engine that is no part of GIMP.
This page lets you customize the behaviour of the GIMP help system.
Show tool tips
Tool tips are small help pop-ups that appear when the pointer hovers for a moment over some element of the interface such as a button or icon. Sometimes they explain what the element does; sometimes they give you hints about non-obvious ways to use it. If you find them too distracting you can disable them here by unchecking this option. We recommend that you leave them enabled unless you are a very advanced user.
This option controls whether the help buttons are shown on every tool dialog which may be used alternatively to invoke the help system.
This drop-down list lets you select between Use a locally installed copy and Use the online version. See .

Four piles at top. To be built in suit from Ace to King. Topmost card in each Foundation can be played back on to the Tableau.
Thirteen piles. Four cards are dealt face up on each pile. Kings are moved to the bottom of their respective piles.
The top card on each Tableau can be moved to another Tableau pile if it has a value of one lower than the top card on the second pile. Suit is not relevant. Empty Tableau piles cannot be filled.
Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card in the Tableau will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
Each card moved to the Foundation scores one point.
A quick short game with not much thought involved cover is best played with minimal thought and quick reflexes.
Written by Zach Keene
Top left slot. Since all remaining cards are always dealt to the tableau it will always be empty. Redeals are unlimited.
Rightmost piles in the top row; the aces are placed here upon the start of the game. Build up in suit from ace to king.
Up to thirteen piles dealt four cards at a time until the stock is exhausted. Tableau piles can be built down in suit.
Written by Wa (logicplace.com)
Four piles. Deal 13 cards to each. (This is all of the cards.)
Four to six empty slots that you build in either direction.
Move all cards to Foundation.
Any card can be placed as the first card in the Foundation. Foundation piles can be built up or down from the top card's value disregarding suit. Kings can be placed on Aces and vice versa.
Remove cards in pairs that add up to thirteen with Aces being one Jacks being eleven and Queens being twelve. Kings are removed singly.
Empty Tableau piles are automatically filled from the Stock.
Go as fast as you can.
Top left pile. All cards except the Ace to four of clubs are placed here at beginning of play. Cards are dealt singly to Waste.
Directly to the right of Stock. Can only hold one card at a time. Card must immediately be placed on either a Foundation pile or on to the Reserve pile of your choice.
Deal Three Cards If you deal three cards at a time from the stock you get to go through the deck three times.
Autoplay If autoplay is activated cards are automatically placed to foundation piles as soon as possible.
Try to keep reserve. It's not easy to get Napoleon to his tomb but keep trying.
Top left pile. Dealt to the Tableau in the manner described below.
Five by five grid each capable of holding one card. One card dealt to each space at the beginning of game. Empty spaces automatically filled by moving cards from the right to the left from the leftmost card of the row below to the rightmost space and from the Stock to all otherwise empty spaces.
Top left pile. Deck placed here after dealing onto Tableau. Clicking deals one card face up to every pile.
Top eight piles. Only used to hold sequences of cards going down from King down to Ace once completed.
Ten piles. Four piles (piles 1 4 7 and 10) get dealt 5 cards down and one card up while rest of the piles get dealt 4 cards down and one card up. Cards can be built down regardless of suit. Sequences of cards in the same suit can be moved as a unit. Empty piles can be filled with any card or movable unit.
To have eight sequences of cards going down from King down to Ace in the foundation.
If you want an extremely difficult challenge do not move completed sequences of cards to a foundation. You can also win by leaving the same eight sequences in the tableau. This is harder because there are fewer empty piles available. In fact it is nearly impossible.
To be taken from Stock. Top card and bottom card available for play.
Deal cards face up in seven overlapping rows starting with one card on the first row increasing by one per row and staggering the piles as to achieve a pyramid.
Cards can be flipped singly from the Stock to the Waste. Top and bottom cards are available for play either by themselves or with the available cards in the pyramid. The top card of the Waste can also be played with the second card on the Waste. There is no redeal.
This game is easier to win than Thirteen. This is because you can plan ahead and avoid blocks by strategic play.

Managing archives
Introduction to the GNOME Archive Manager.
Archive Manager is an application for managing archive files for example .zip or .tar files; it is designed to be easy to use. Archive Manager provides all the tools that are necessary for creating modifying and extracting archives.
An archive consists of one or more files and folders along with metadata. It may be encrypted in part or as a whole. Archive files are useful for storing data and transferring it between computers as they allow you to collect multiple files into one.
With Archive Manager you can

Four-in-a-row is a strategy game for GNOME. The aim of the game is to stack four of your marbles in a horizontal vertical or diagonal line while stopping your opponent from doing the same with their marbles.
PAM
GDM uses PAM for login authentication. PAM stands for Pluggable Authentication Module and is used by most programs that request authentication on your computer. It allows the administrator to configure specific authentication behavior for different login programs (such as ssh login GUI screensaver etc.)
PAM is complicated and highly configurable and this documentation does not intend to explain this in detail. Instead it is intended to give an overview of how PAM configuration relates with GDM how PAM is commonly configured with GDM and known issues. It is expected that a person needing to do PAM configuration would need to do further reading of PAM documentation to understand how to configure PAM and to understand terms used in this section.
PAM configuration has different but similar interfaces on different Operating Systems so check the pam.d or pam.conf man page for details. Be sure you read the PAM documentation and are comfortable with the security implications of any changes you intend to make to your configuration.
Note that by default GDM uses the "gdm" PAM service name for normal login and the "gdm-autologin" PAM service name for automatic login. These services may not be defined in your pam.d or pam.conf configured file. If there is no entry then GDM will use the default PAM behavior. On most systems this should work fine. However the automatic login feature may not work if the gdm-autologin service is not defined.
IncludeAll=true
If true then the face browser will show all users on the local machine. If false the face browser will only show users who have recently logged in.
When this key is true GDM will call fgetpwent() to get a list of local users on the system. Any users with a user id less than 500 (or 100 if running on Oracle Solaris) are filtered out. The Face Browser also will display any users that have previously logged in on the system (for example NIS/LDAP users). It gets this list via calling the ck-history ConsoleKit interface. It will also filter out any users which do not have a valid shell (valid shells are any shell that getusershell() returns - /sbin/nologin or /bin/false are considered invalid shells even if getusershell() returns them).
If false then GDM more simply only displays users that have previously logged in on the system (local or NIS/LDAP users) by calling the ck-history ConsoleKit interface.

The following is an example onboard.desktop file
The following is an example mousetweaks.desktop file
Note the line with the AutostartCondition that links both desktop files to the GConf key for the on-screen keyboard.
To disable GOK from starting the desktop file for the GOK on-screen keyboard must be removed or deactivated. Otherwise onboard and GOK would simultaneously be started. This can be done by removing the gok.desktop file from the GDM autostart directory or by adding the "Hidden=true" key setting to the gok.desktop file.
After making these changes GOK will no longer be started when the user activates the on-screen keyboard in the GDM session; but onboard and mousetweaks will instead be launched.
You can also move your mouse cursor to the top of the screen and wait for the menu bar to appear. When the menu bar appears select the Leave Fullscreen button.

You can do an extra check by looking through the copied files and folders on the destination media. By checking to make sure that the files and folders you transferred are actually there in the backup you can have extra confidence that the process was successful.
If you find that you do regular backups of large amounts of data you may find it easier to use a dedicated backup program such as Déjà Dup. Such a program is more powerful and more reliable than just copying and pasting files.
Learn how often you should backup your important files to make sure that they are safe.
Frequency of backups
How often you make backups will depend on the type of data to be backed up. For example if you are running a network environment with critical data stored on your servers then even nightly backups may not be enough.

Using the command line
Some of the instructions in this guide ask you to type commands into the command line (Terminal). You can find the Terminal application in the Activities overview.
If you are not familiar with using a command line don’t worry — this guide will direct you at each step. All you need to remember is that commands are case-sensitive (so you must type them exactly as they appear here) and to press Enter after typing each command to run it.
WEP and WPA are ways of encrypting data on wireless networks.
When the charge level of the battery gets too low your computer will automatically turn off. It does this to make sure that the battery does not completely discharge since this is bad for the battery. If the battery just ran out the computer would not have time to shut down properly either.
Bear in mind that when your computer automatically turns off your applications and documents are not saved. To avoid losing your work save it before the battery gets too low.
Some wireless devices have problems handling when your computer is suspended and does not resume properly.
I have no wireless network when I wake up my computer
If you have suspended your computer you may find that your wireless internet connection does not work when you resume it again. This happens when the driver for the wireless device does not fully support certain power saving features. Typically the wireless connection fails to turn on properly when the computer is resumed.

Damned Lies is able to filter strings which are seldom visible in user interfaces so as translation teams can concentrate on most visible strings.
If you think you found a better filter for a specific module please submit a bug report with your proposal.

Welcome to GNOME. Getting started is easy - install our dev tools and take a look at a tutorial.
Introspection
GLib provides the core application building blocks for libraries and applications written in C. It provides the core object system used in GNOME the main loop implementation and a large set of utility functions for strings and common data structures.
This freedesktop.org specification describes how applications can be started automatically after the user has logged in and how media can request a specific application to be executed or a specific file on the media to be opened after the media has been mounted.
Desktop Notifications Specification
This specification standardizes the interface to desktop notification services.

Which characters are available to you and their order is determined by the alphabet file. For example you might use alphabet.english.xml. Dasher comes with many alternative alphabets. You can edit alphabet files to change which characters are in the alphabet or their order. When you edit this xml file it might be a good idea to save the new file with a new name and change the name of the alphabets in the new file to avoid confusion. Each field in the xml file specifies a symbol by three items the character that should be displayed (d=); the character that goes into the text when this symbol is selected (t=); and the background colour number of the box for this symbol (b=) of which more below.
Personalizing the colour scheme
You can change the colours of the Dasher world in two ways. The colour file (for example colour.xml or colour.euroasian.xml) specifies the 200 colours in the palette that Dasher uses. Each line specifies red green blue values.
You can change which of these colours is used for each symbol's box by changing the b; field for that symbol in the alphabet file.
Dasher works in hundreds of languages.
If your music is organized by album EasyTAG can search online databases using the CDDB protocol and automatically fill in several tag fields.
Select all the files in the album that you want to search for. The ordering of the files must match the track order on the album.
Select Miscellaneous CDDB Search.
Select an album from the list of results and the track information will be shown to the right. If the album is not the one that you wanted try selecting another result in the list.
To fill in the tags of the selected files using the details in the search result press Apply.

What is People Nearby?
The People Nearby service is a serverless communication service you do not need to connect and authenticate to a central server in order to use it.
This kind of serverless messaging system is restricted to a local area network and an active Internet connection is not necessary.
The people that use this service inside the same local area network will be auto-discovered and it will be possible to send them messages and files as with other services.
All the modern local area networks should be able to support this kind of service.

The calculated sunset time for your location
Sunrise and sunset times are calculated locally from latitude and longitude information stored on your computer. Some conditions such as refraction of light through the air are hard to model. Resultantly the calculated values for sunrise and sunset may be off by up to 10 minutes.
The Forecast tabbed section displays a forecast for the location for the immediate future usually the next five days.
Forecasts are only available for some locations in the U.S.A Australia and the United Kingdom.
By default the Radar Map tabbed section is not displayed in the Forecast dialog. Weather Report downloads the radar maps from www.weather.com. If the radar map is not available from www.weather.com Weather Report displays a question mark. To go to the www.weather.com web site click on the Visit Weather.com button.

The Good the Bad and the Ugly
GStreamer plugins come into three categories good bad and ugly. You may need to install plugins from any category to ensure compatibility with your media files. Whether or not you install them is up to you and may depend on your country's jurisdiction regarding software patents. An overview of gstreamer plugins and their classification into categories can be found on the Gstreamer website.
The "Good" plugins are high quality plugins under the LGPL license. These plugins are considered safe and recommended at any time. To install them search for packages containing gstreamer plugins good in your distribution's repositories.
The "Bad" plugins are plugins whose code quality is not good enough or are not considered tested well enough. The licensing may or may not be LGPL. To install them search for packages containing gstreamer plugins bad in your distribution's repositories.
The "Ugly" plugins are good quality plugins whose license is not LGPL or with licensing issues. To install them search for packages containing containing gstreamer plugins ugly in your distribution's repositories.
Detaching the previewer into a separate window
You can detach the previewer into a separate window by clicking the Detach the viewer button in the Playback toolbar. From the separate window you can play the preview in fullscreen. This will also allow other parts of the main window to take up the space the previewer occupied. You can attach the previewer back by closing the separate window.
Pitivi inhibits the screensaver while playing the video preview.
Left pane
The left pane contains media and effect libraries. You can switch between them by selecting the appropriate tab. The Media Library displays the imported media files in your project and allows you to manage them. The Effect library contains number of audio and video effects applicable to clips.
Click on each clip you want to toggle the selection.
To clear the selection click anywhere on the timeline in an empty region.
By default clicking in the timeline changes the selection and also moves the playhead. To have a better control of the playhead you can disable seeking when left-clicking. This way left-clicking only changes the selection and the playhead position won't be lost when you make selections. This can be specified at Menu buttonPreferencesLeft click also seeks. You can still use right-click to move the playhead as before see  for details.
Grouping and ungrouping clips
The grouping and ungrouping functions are useful when you want to add or separate audio tracks from video clips or when you want to create a block of clips that you can select edit and move all at once.
From the Media Library you can insert one or more clips by selecting them (use the Ctrl or Shift keys to select multiple clips) and doing one of the following
Dragging and dropping them onto a place in the timeline.
Clicking the Insert the selected clips at the end of the timeline button in the Media Library header.
Pressing the Insert key.
When following the second and third options (clicking or pressing insert) the new clips will be inserted one after another on the longest layer of the timeline where the last clip ends.
If you want to work within the resulting image within Shotwell you'll need to import it yourself.
Shotwell is a non-destructive photo editor - it does not modify your original photos.
What happens to the original when I edit a photo?
Shotwell is a non-destructive photo editor. It does not modify your original photographs. That is to say if you crop a photo or adjust its colors the photo file on disc remains untouched. Shotwell stores your edits in a database and applies them on the fly as necessary. This means you can undo any alterations you make to a photograph.
If you want to see what a photo looked like before your modifications press the Shift key. The original photo will be displayed as long as you hold the key down.
Shotwell normally displays each photo's rating in its lower left-hand corner. You can turn off the display of ratings using the ViewRatings menu item.
You can increase or decrease a photo's rating using the Set RatingIncrease and Set RatingDecrease commands or the keyboard shortcuts lt; and gt;.
Remove photos from the library or delete them from your computer entirely.
Removing and deleting photos
You may remove photos from your library and you may additionally delete them entirely from your hard disk.
Shotwell can be used with plugins which are companion shared libraries that can add support for new publishing destinations or new slideshow transitions.
To see a list of installed plugins choose EditPreferences and in the Preferences window click on the Plugins tab. You'll see a list of currently-installed plugins each with a checkbox by it and you may enable or disable each by selecting or deselecting the checkbox by its name.
Full documentation on how to develop new plugins is available at http//redmine.yorba.org/projects/shotwell/wiki/ShotwellArchWritingPlugins

The APSO Extension
The most common usage of URLs is on the internet when specifying web pages. Example for protocols are http ftp or file. The file protocol specifier is used when referring to a file on the local file system.
The same applies to the locale settings for date time and currency formats. The Basic format code will be interpreted and displayed according to your locale setting.
The color values of the 16 basic colors are as follows
Color Value

380 Incorrect property value
382 This property is read-only
394 This property is write-only
420 Invalid object reference
423 Property or method not found
Double Variables
Currency Variables
Currency variables are internally stored as 64-bit numbers (8 Bytes) and displayed as a fixed-decimal number with 15 non-decimal and 4 decimal places. The values range from -922337203685477.5808 to +922337203685477.5807. Currency variables are used to calculate currency values with a high precision. The type-declaration character is "@".
String Variables
String variables can hold character strings with up to 65535 characters. Each character is stored as the corresponding Unicode value. String variables are suitable for word processing within programs and for temporary storage of any non-printable character up to a maximum length of 64 Kbytes. The memory required for storing string variables depends on the number of characters in the variable. The type-declaration character is "$".

Array at second place represents the second array with the same number of rows.
Select a square range. Choose the MMULT function. Select the first Array then select the second Array. Using Function Wizard mark the Array check box. Click OK. The output array will appear in the first selected range.
TRANSPOSE function
Transposes the rows and columns of an array.
TRANSPOSE(Array)
Returns a cell address (reference) as text according to the specified row and column numbers. You can determine whether the address is interpreted as an absolute address (for example $A$1) or as a relative address (as A1) or in a mixed form (A$1 or $A1). You can also specify the name of the sheet.
For interoperability the ADDRESS and INDIRECT functions support an optional parameter to specify whether the R1C1 address notation instead of the usual A1 notation should be used.
In ADDRESS the parameter is inserted as the fourth parameter shifting the optional sheet name parameter to the fifth position.
In INDIRECT the parameter is appended as the second parameter.
In both functions if the argument is inserted with the value 0 then the R1C1 notation is used. If the argument is not given or has a value other than 0 then the A1 notation is used.
LookupArray is the reference searched. A lookup array can be a single row or column or part of a single row or column.
Type may take the values 1 0 or -1. If Type = 1 or if this optional parameter is missing it is assumed that the first column of the search array is sorted in ascending order. If Type = -1 it is assumed that the column in sorted in descending order. This corresponds to the same function in Microsoft Excel.
If Type = 1 or the third parameter is missing the index of the last value that is smaller or equal to the search criterion is returned. This applies even when the search array is not sorted. For Type = -1 the first value that is larger or equal is returned.
=MATCH(200;D1D100) searches the area D1D100 which is sorted by column D for the value 200. As soon as this value is reached the number of the row in which it was found is returned. If a higher value is found during the search in the column the number of the previous row is returned.
OFFSET function
Text is the text that represents a Roman number.
=ARABIC("MXIV") returns 1014
=ARABIC("MMII") returns 2002
ASC function
The ASC function converts full-width to half-width ASCII and katakana characters. Returns a text string.

LEN function
Returns the length of a string including spaces.
LEN("Text")
=SUBSTITUTE("123123123";"3";"abc") returns 12abc12abc12abc.
=SUBSTITUTE("123123123";"3";"abc";2) returns 12312abc123.
T function
This function returns the target text or a blank text string if the target is not text.
T(Value)
Libraries can be reloaded during runtime and their contents can be analyzed by the administrative functions. For each function information is available about count and type of parameters internal and external function names and an administrative number.
The functions are called synchronously and return their results immediately. Real time functions (asynchronous functions) are also possible; however they are not explained in detail because of their complexity.

CHISQ.DIST.RT compares the Chi square value to be given for a random sample that is calculated from the sum of (observed value-expected value)^2/expected value for all values with the theoretical Chi square distribution and determines from this the probability of error for the hypothesis to be tested.
The probability determined by CHISQ.DIST.RT can also be determined by CHITEST.
CHISQ.DIST.RT(Number; DegreesFreedom)
C (optional) = 0 or False calculates the density function C = 1 or True calculates the distribution.
=GAMMADIST(2;1;1;1) yields 0.86.
GAMMA.DIST function
The inverse function is GAMMAINV or GAMMA.INV.
This function is identical to GAMMADIST and was introduced for interoperability with other office suites.
LOGNORM.INV functioninverse of lognormal distribution
This function is identical to LOGINV and was introduced for interoperability with other office suites.
LOGNORM.INV(Number; Mean; StDev)
Number (required) is the probability value for which the inverse standard logarithmic distribution is to be calculated.
Mean (required) is the arithmetic mean of the standard logarithmic distribution.
Data2 represents the array of the second data set.
=PEARSON(A1A30;B1B30) returns the Pearson correlation coefficient of both data sets.
PHI function
Returns the values of the distribution function for a standard normal distribution.
PHI(Number)
=STANDARDIZE(11;10;1) returns 1. The value 11 in a normal distribution with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 1 is as much above the mean of 10 as the value 1 is above the mean of the standard normal distribution.
NORMSINV function         normal distribution;inverse of standard
Returns the inverse of the standard normal cumulative distribution.
NORMSINV(Number)
Number is the probability to which the inverse standard normal distribution is calculated.
Returns the probability that values in a range are between two limits. If there is no End value this function calculates the probability based on the principle that the Data values are equal to the value of Start.
PROB(Data; Probability; Start; End)
Probability is the array or range of the corresponding probabilities.
Start is the start value of the interval whose probabilities are to be summed.
=PROB(A1A50;B1B50;50;60) returns the probability with which a value within the range of A1A50 is also within the limits between 50 and 60. Every value within the range of A1A50 has a probability within the range of B1B50.

Chart Type Area
area chartschart types;area
An area chart shows values as points on the y axis. The x axis shows categories. The y values of each data series are connected by a line. The area between each two lines is filled with a color. The area chart's focus is to emphasize the changes from one category to the next.
Normal - this subtype plots all values as absolute y values. It first plots the area of the last column in the data range then the next to last and so on and finally the first column of data is drawn. Thus if the values in the first column are higher than other values the last drawn area will hide the other areas.
Stacked - this subtypes plots values cumulatively stacked on each other. It ensures that all values are visible and no data set is hidden by others. However the y values no longer represent absolute values except for the last column which is drawn at the bottom of the stacked areas.
Based on all five data columns volume open low high and close Type 4 combines a chart of Type 2 with a column chart for the transaction volume.
Because measurement for transaction volume might be "units" a second y axis is introduced in chart Type 3 and Type 4. The price axis is shown on the right side and the volume axis on the left side.

Java; definition
The Java programming language is a platform independent programming language that is especially suited for use in the Internet. Web pages and applications programmed with Java class files can be used on all modern operating systems. Programs using Java programming language are usually developed in a Java development environment and then compiled to a "byte code".
A proxy is a computer in the network acting as a kind of clipboard for data transfer. Whenever you access the Internet from a company network and request a Web page that has already been read by a colleague the proxy will be able to display the page much quicker as long as it's still in the memory. All that has to be checked in this case is that the page stored in the proxy is the latest version. If this is the case the page won't have to be downloaded from the much slower Internet but can be loaded directly from the proxy.
SGML; definition
Rich Text Format (RTF) is a file format developed for the exchange of text files. A special feature is that the formatting is converted into directly readable text information. Unfortunately in comparison to other file formats this creates relatively large files.
Saving Relatively and Absolutely
In various dialogs (for example Tools - AutoText) you can select whether you want to save files relatively or absolutely.
If you choose to save relatively the references to embedded graphics or other objects in your document will be saved relative to the location in the file system. In this case it does not matter where the referenced directory structure is recorded. The files will be found regardless of location as long as the reference remains on the same drive or volume. This is important if you want to make the document available to other computers that may have a completely different directory structure drive or volume names. It is also recommended to save relatively if you want to create a directory structure on an Internet server.
If you prefer absolute saving all references to other files will also be defined as absolute based on the respective drive volume or root directory. The advantage is that the document containing the references can be moved to other directories or folders and the references remain valid.

MediaWiki Formats
The following list gives an overview of the text formats that the Wiki Publisher can upload to the wiki server.
The OpenDocument format used by Writer and the MediaWiki format are quite different. Only a subset of all features can be transformed from one format to the other.
Apply a heading paragraph style to the headings in your Writer document. The wiki will show the heading styles of the same outline level formatted as defined by the wiki engine.
Native OpenDocument hyperlinks are transformed into “external” wiki links. Therefore the built-in linking facility of OpenDocument should only be used to create links that point to other sites outside the wiki web. For creating wiki links that point to other subjects of the same wiki domain use wiki links.

Thunderbird is currently transitioning to an independent organization. Being independent we can shape our own fate but there is significant infrastructure that must be maintained to deliver the application to our tens of millions of users. For Thunderbird to survive and continue to evolve we need your support and ask for your donation today. All the money donated will go directly to funding Thunderbird development and infrastructure.
Thunderbird is no longer funded by Mozilla. Fortunately there is an active community keeping it running and developing it further. But to survive long term the project needs funding.
Thunderbird is the leading open source cross-platform and calendaring client free for business and personal use. We want it to stay secure and become even better. A donation will allow us to hire developers pay for infrastructure and continue to improve.

Equivalent to «Double-Quote Mode» but using single quotes instead.
Single-Quote Mode
If your theme retrieves the URL of the featured image and outputs it within an img tag this mode might be the one you need. Compatible themes include Newspaper Newsmag Enfold and others.
Double-Quote Mode
This mode assumes your theme uses the function (get)thepostthumbnail for inserting featured images. For example WordPress default themes should work with this setting.

What rights you have over your data
For users that register on our website (if any) we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see edit or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
If you leave a comment the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
In this section you should explain how long you retain personal data collected or processed by the web site. While it is your responsibility to come up with the schedule of how long you keep each dataset for and why you keep it that information does need to be listed here. For example you may want to say that you keep contact form entries for six months analytics records for a year and customer purchase records for ten years.
How long we retain your data
If you absolutely have to make direct edits to this plugin use a file manager to create a copy with a new name and hang on to the original. That way you can re-enable a functional version if something goes wrong.
You appear to be making direct edits to your plugin in the WordPress dashboard. We recommend that you don#8217;t! Editing plugins directly may introduce incompatibilities that break your site and your changes may be lost in future updates.

The Categories and Tags Converter link on this screen will take you to the Import screen where that Converter is one of the plugins you can install. Once that plugin is installed the Activate Plugin amp; Run Importer link will take you to a screen where you can choose to convert tags into categories or vice versa.
Categories have hierarchy meaning that you can nest sub-categories. Tags do not have hierarchy and cannot be nested. Sometimes people start out using one on their posts then later realize that the other would work better for their content.
For most themes the header text is your Site Title and Tagline as defined in the General Settings section.
If your theme has more than one default header image or you have uploaded more than one custom header image you have the option of having WordPress display a randomly different image on each page of your site. Click the #8220;Random#8221; radio button next to the Uploaded Images or Default Images section to enable this feature.
If you want to convert your categories to tags (or vice versa) use the Categories and Tags Converter available from the Import screen.
