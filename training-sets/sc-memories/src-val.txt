Heuristic processing means that calibre will scan your book for common patterns and fix them. As the name implies this involves guesswork which means that it could end up worsening the result of a conversion if calibre guesses wrong. Therefore it is disabled by default. Often if a conversion does not turn out as you expect turning on heuristics can improve matters. Read more about the various heuristic processing options in the User Manual.

Normally the SONY readers get the cover image from the e-book file itself. With this option calibre will send a separate cover image to the reader useful if you are sending DRMed books in which you cannot change the cover. WARNING This option should only be used with newer SONY readers 350 650 950 and newer.
Refresh separate covers when using automatic management (newer readers)

Used for right-to-left publications like manga. Causes landscape pages to be split into portrait pages from right to left.
Enable Despeckle. Reduces speckle noise. May greatly increase processing time.
Don't sort the files found in the comic alphabetically by name. Instead use the order they were added to the comic.

In order to use this functionality the installation's database user must have privileges to create triggers (in MySQL 5.0 – and in MySQL 5.1 if binary logging is enabled – this means the SUPER privilege). This install either does not seem to have the required privilege enabled.
(Multilingual support currenly cannot be enabled on installations with enabled logging.)
Word Replacements
Change all occurrences of a word or phrase in CiviCRM screens (e.g. replace all occurences of 'Contribution' with 'Donation').
Partial matches will be replaced unless you click "Exact Match". EXAMPLE replacing 'Contribution' with 'Donation' will also replace 'Contributions' with 'Donations' unless 'Exact Match' is checked.
Use 'Exact Match' if you don't want partial matches to be replaced OR you are replacing a complete phrase (e.g. replace 'Create Printable Letters (PDF)' with  'Write Letters').
IMPORTANT Replacements are case-sensitive whether 'Exact Match' is checked or not.

this variable controls the maximum amount of memory (in MB) a module may use during image processing. lower values will force memory hungry modules to process image with increasing number of tiles. setting this to 0 will omit any limit. values below 500 will be treated as 500 (needs a restart).

if set to a positive non-zero value this variable defines the minimum amount of memory (in MB) that tiling should take for a single image buffer. has precedence over heuristics based on hostmemorylimit (needs a restart).

This behaviour can be mimicked by the other tools of the po4a suite (for example with Makefiles) but it is rather difficult to do and exhausting to redo the same complicated Makefiles for each project using po4a.
The (mandatory) argument is the path to the configuration file to use.  Its syntax aims at being simple and close to the configuration files used by the intl-tools projects.
This is an optional command that can simplify the whole config file and will make it more scalable. You have to specify a list of the languages in which you want to translate the documents. This is as simple as
[po4alangs] fr de
This will enable you to expand B to all the specified languages in the rest of the config file.
sgml
Even if somewhat superseded by XML nowadays this format is still used rather often for documents which are more than a few screens long. It allows you to make complete books. Updating the translation of so long documents can reveal to be a real nightmare. B reveals often useless when the original text was re-indented after update. Fortunately po4a can help you in that process.
Currently only the DebianDoc and DocBook DTD are supported but adding support to a new one is really easy. It is even possible to use po4a on an unknown SGML DTD without changing the code by providing the needed information on the command line. See L for details.
TeX / LaTeX
texinfo
Yes in po4a each paragraph is translated separately (in fact each module decides this but all existing modules do so and yours should also).  There are two main advantages to this approach
When the technical parts of the document are hidden from the scene the translator can't mess with them. The fewer markers we present to the translator the less error he can do.
Cutting the document helps in isolating the changes to the original document. When the original is modified finding what parts of the translation need to be updated is eased by this process.
Even with these advantages some people don't like the idea of translating each paragraph separately. Here are some of the answers I can give to their fear
This approach proved successfully in the KDE project and allows people there to produce the biggest corpus of translated and up to date documentation I know.
IEtextE -- italic text
equivalent to \fItext\fP or ".I text"
BEtextE -- bold text
equivalent to \fBtext\fP or ".B text"
REtextE -- roman text
Space separated list of extra tags (beside the DTD provided ones)  containing other tags some of them being of category B.
The layout within those tags should not be changed. The paragraph won't get wrapped and no extra indentation space or new line will be added for cosmetic purpose.
Tags not needing to be closed.
By default msgids containing only one entity (like 'version;') are skipped for the translator comfort. Activating this option prevents this optimisation. It can be useful if the document contains a construction like "Aacute;" even if I doubt such things to ever happen
It does work only with the DebianDoc and DocBook DTD. Adding support for a new DTD should be very easy. The mechanism is the same for every DTD you just have to give a list of the existing tags and some of their characteristics.

This function returns a boolean that says if the next tag in the input stream is a breaking tag or not (inline tag).  It leaves the input stream intact.

This function translates the next tag from the input stream.  Using each tag type's custom translation functions.
taginlist($@)
This function returns a string value that says if the first argument (a tag hierarchy) matches any of the tags from the second argument (a list of tags or tag hierarchies). If it doesn't match it returns 0. Else it returns the matched tag's options (the characters in front of the tag) or 1 (if that tag doesn't have options).

Some screens will be automatically configured depending on your hardware and the type of media you used to start the installation. You can still change the detected settings in any screen. Screens which have not been automatically configured and therefore require your attention before you begin the installation are marked by an exclamation mark. You can not start the actual installation process before you finish configuring these settings.
Consoles and Logging During the Installation
The following sections describe how to access logs and an interactive shell during the installation. This is useful when troubleshooting problems but should not be necessary in most cases.

DVD images boot directly into the installation enviroment and allow you to choose from a variety of packages that are provided with it. In Fedora 21 the DVD option is only available in the Fedora Server flavor.
Use the Fedora Server DVD image when you want customized Fedora Server installations using an offline installation source.
The netinstall image boots directly into the installation environment and uses the online Fedora package repositories as the installation source. With a netinstall image you can select a wide variety of packages to create a customized installation of Fedora.
The Fedora Server netinstall image is a universal one and can be used to install any Fedora flavor or your own set of favorite packages.
For many ARM systems Fedora provides preconfigured filesystem images. Write the image to removable media and boot directly into a Fedora installation that's ready to use.
By calculating the image's checksum on your own computer and comparing it to the original checksum you can verify the image has not been tampered with or corrupted. The original checksum values are provided at  and are gpg signed to demonstrate their integrity.

Apache Accumulo
The Apache Accumulo sorted distributed key/value store is a robust scalable high performance data storage and retrieval system. Apache Accumulo is based on Google's BigTable design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop Zookeeper and Thrift. Apache Accumulo features a few novel improvements on the BigTable design in the form of cell-based access control and a server-side programming mechanism that can modify key/value pairs at various points in the data management process.
Please note that Accumulo's optional monitor service is not provided in the initial F21 release. It will be made available as soon as all its dependencies are in place.
Apache HBase
Apache HBase is used when you need random real-time read/write access to your Big Data. Apache HBase hosts very large tables -- billions of rows X millions of columns -- atop clusters of commodity hardware. Apache HBase is a distributed versioned non-relational database modeled after Google's Bigtable A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data by Chang et al. Just as Bigtable leverages the distributed data storage provided by the Google File System Apache HBase provides Bigtable-like capabilities on top of Hadoop and HDFS.
Improved Scala Ecosystem
Fedora now features significantly improved support for the Scala ecosystem with the inclusion of sbt version 0.13.1 and several other key Scala infrastructure packages. These packages include
akka a toolkit for developing actor-based systems
json4s a unified interface to JSON parsers and generators
sbinary a typed Scala interface for reading and writing binary formats
Fedora PRODVER; can be installed and used on systems with limited resources for some applications. Text vnc or kickstart installations are advised over graphical installation for systems with very low memory. Larger package sets require more memory during installation so users with less than 768MB of system memory may have better results preforming a minimal install and adding to it afterward.
Display resolution
Graphical Installation requires 800x600 resolution or higher
Graphical installation of Fedora PRODVER; requires a minimum screen resolution of 800x600. Owners of devices with lower resolution such as some netbooks should use text or VNC installation.
Once installed Fedora will support these lower resolution devices. The minimum resolution requirement applies only to graphical installation.
Youtube features are improved with support for YouTube channels added.
Improved Vimeo integration.
Enhanced support for mobile devices and standalone media players.
Numerous interface advancements.
Support your favorite content creators with Flattr integration.
Journal messages can be forwarded to remote systems without using a syslog daemon. The systemd-journal-remote and systemd-journal-upload packages provide receiver and sender daemons. Communication is done over HTTPS.
The cupsd service now logs output into the journal. See  for details.
systemd 215
systemd in Fedora 21 has been updated to version 215. This release includes substantial enhancements including improved resource management service isolation and other security improvements and network management from systemd-networkd.
Many of these improvements enhance management of services running inside containers and management of the containers themselves. systemd-nspawn creates securely isolated containers and tools such as machinectl are available to manage them. systemd-networkd provides network services for the containers and systemd itself manages resource allocations.

Michel Social Media  Web Researcher
Things outside of our daily plans always come up and sometimes we have to give up on our plan and attend to these more urgent unpredictable issues. Don't worry about it!
At the end of the day jot down anything you may have accomplished or spent time on outside of the scope of the to-dos you planned for the day. Create a fresh To-Do note for tomorrow and copy any items you didn't accomplish today into it for your plan tomorrow. For any items you completed today cross them off your "Master To-Do List" as well.
You can keep all these lists always visible in the Gnote notes list by clicking the little thumbtack icon next to them in the list. Keeping daily to-do lists using Gnote is a great way to review what you've accomplished at the end of the week and makes it easy to write weekly status reports if your job requires that.
2. Clean up those sticky-notes all over your desk!
Tear them all down! That's right! Gather up all your sticky-notes scraps of paper notes written on the back of other papers and make a pile. One-by-one go through each piece of paper and transcribe it into a new digital Gnote. Now your desk is much neater and you can search across all of your notes.

ARM® Technology
Sugar sets aside the traditional “office-desktop” metaphor presenting a child-friendly graphical environment. Sugar automatically saves your progress to a "Journal" on your stick so teachers and parents can easily pull up "all collaborative web browsing sessions done in the past week" or "papers written with Daniel and Sarah in the last 24 hours" with a simple query rather than memorizing complex file/folder structures. Applications in Sugar are known as Activities some of which are described below.

The above table shows the main networking tools provided by the OpenSSH suite. The older tools in the above table are much less secure as they transmit credentials (such as username and password) in clear text over the network or Internet. These details could potentially be extracted from the data stream and leave the hosts vulnerable to unauthorized access. The encrypted data streams in the OpenSSH tools listed in the table provide an extra layer of security to protecting network details by encrypting the entire transmission including passwords. This is an important attribute when transmitting credentials over a network and especially over an untrusted network (such as the Internet).
OpenSSH is released under the free and permissive BSD License. It can be used for any and all purposes including commercial use.

While running this live image you are in control. Unlike reading about Fedora in print or online you are not limited to a set of screenshots or options chosen by others. Select which tasks or applications to explore with complete freedom.
You can experiment with this live image with no disruption to your previous computing environment documents or desktop. Shut down or hibernate your current operating system restart with the live image and restart the original operating system when finished. Your previous environment returns with no changes made.
You can use the live image to evaluate whether Fedora recognizes and properly configures your hardware devices.
Important — Full hardware recognition
In some cases the live image might not offer the full range of hardware support offered by an installed Fedora system. You might be able to manually configure additional devices in the live image. If you use the live image from a DVD you must repeat these steps each time you use the live image.

Server Settings
Changing to SELinux disabled requires a reboot.  It is not recommended.  If you later decide to turn SELinux back on the system will be required to relabel.  If you just want to see if SELinux is causing a problem on your system you can go to permissive mode which will only log errors and not enforce SELinux policy.  Permissive mode does not require a reboot.  Do you wish to continue?
Changing to SELinux enabled will cause a relabel of the entire file system on the next boot. Relabeling takes a long time depending on the size of the file system.  Do you wish to continue?

First a statistic the GIMP code base contains about 230000 lines of C code and most of these lines were rewritten in the evolution from 1.2 to 2.0. From the user's point of view however GIMP 2 is fundamentally similar to GIMP 1; the features are similar enough that GIMP 1 users won't be lost. As part of the restructuring work the developers cleaned up the code greatly an investment that while not directly visible to the user will ease maintenance and make future additions less painful. Thus the GIMP 2 code base is significantly better organized and more maintainable than was the case for GIMP 1.2.

Plug-in Development
There are new things for a plug-in developer to enjoy as well. For example procedures can now give a detailed error description in case of an error and the error can be propagated to the user.
GIMP 2.6 also further enhances its scripting abilities. In particular there is now a much richer API for the creation and manipulation of text layers. Here is a list of new symbols in GIMP 2.6 .

To understand some of the idiosyncrasies of text handling it may help for you to realize that a text layer contains more information than the pixel data that you see it also contains a representation of the text in a text-editor format. You can see this in the text-editor window that pops up while you are using the Text tool. Every time you alter the text the image layer is redrawn to reflect your changes.
Now suppose you create a text layer and then operate on it in some way that does not involve the Text tool rotate it for example. Suppose you then come back and try to edit it using the Text tool. As soon as you edit the text the Text tool will redraw the layer wiping out the results of the operations you performed in the meantime.
Because this danger is not obvious the Text tool tries to protect you from it. If you operate on a text layer and then later try to edit the text a message pops up warning you that your alterations will be undone and giving you three options
edit the text anyway;
create a new text layer with the same text as the existing layer leaving the existing layer unchanged.
Drag and drop an image into the Toolbox window from a file browser to open the image in its own Image window or tab.
Dragging an image file into the Layer dialog adds it to the image as a new layer.
CtrlJ this command keeps the zoom level; it adapts window size to image size. The Shrink Wrap command does the same.
CtrlShiftJ this command modifies the zoom level to adapt the image display to the window.

Running GIMP
Most often you start GIMP either by clicking on an icon (if your system is set up to provide you with one) or by typing gimp on a command line. If you have multiple versions of GIMP installed you may need to type gimp-2.8 to get the latest version. You can if you want give a list of image files on the command line after the program name and they will automatically be opened by GIMP as it starts. It is also possible though to open files from within GIMP once it is running.
Most operating systems support file associations which associates a class of files (as determined by their filename extension such as .jpg) with a corresponding application (such as GIMP). When image files are properly associated to GIMP you can double click on an image to open it in GIMP.
Known Platforms
The GIMP is the most widely supported image manipulation available today. The platforms on which GIMP is known to work include
While looking at the dashed line that represents the selection always remember that the line tells only part of the story. If you want to see the selection in complete detail the easiest way is to click the QuickMask button in the lower left corner of the image window. This causes the selection to be shown as a translucent overlay atop the image. Selected areas are unaffected; unselected areas are reddened. The more completely selected an area is the less red it appears.
Many operations work differently in QuickMask mode as mentioned in the QuickMask overview. Use the QuickMask button in the lower left corner of the image window to toggle QuickMask mode on and off.
Same selection in QuickMask mode after feathering.
With the default settings the basic selection tools such as the Rectangle Select tool create sharp selections. Pixels inside the dashed line are fully selected and pixels outside completely unselected. You can verify this by toggling QuickMask you see a clear rectangle with sharp edges surrounded by uniform red. Use the Feather edges checkbox in the Tool Options to toggle between graduated selections and sharp selections. The feather radius which you can adjust determines the distance over which the transition occurs.
If you are following along try this with the Rectangle Select tool and then toggle QuickMask. You will see that the clear rectangle has a fuzzy edge.

Wilber the GIMP mascot
The WilberConstructionKit (in src/images/) allows you to give the mascot a different appearance. It is the work of Tuomas Kuosmanen (tigertATgimp.org).
This section provides a brief introduction to the basic concepts and terminology used in GIMP. The concepts presented here are explained in much greater depth elsewhere. With a few exceptions we have avoided cluttering this section with a lot of links and cross-references everything mentioned here is so high-level that you can easily locate it in the index.
Images are the basic entities used by GIMP. Roughly speaking an image corresponds to a single file such as a TIFF or JPEG file. You can also think of an image as corresponding to a single display window (although in truth it is possible to have multiple windows all displaying the same image). It is not possible to have a single window display more than one image though or for an image to have no window displaying it.
When the tree-view is View as List you can use tags. Please see .
The list search field.
Use CtrlF to open the list search field. An item must be selected for this command to be effective.
You can also use a list search field 
The list search field automatically closes after five seconds if you do nothing.
If it makes things easier for you you can change the default behavior for guides in the Image Windows Appearance page of the Preferences dialog. Disabling Shownbsp;guides is probably a bad idea though for the reason just given.
You can remove the guides with the ImageGuidesRemove all Guides command.
Another use for guides the Guillotine plugin can use guides to slice an image into a set of sub-images.

A filter is a special kind of tool designed to take an input layer or image apply a mathematical algorithm to it and return the input layer or image in a modified format. GIMP uses filters to achieve a variety of effects and those effects are discussed here.
The filters are divided into several categories
Most filters have a Preview where changes in the image are displayed in real time (if the Preview option is checked) before being applied to the image.
Preview submenu
This is the color of the glowing neon tubes. The default is a typical neon-like light blue (38211255). Again a click on the color swatch button brings up the color selector.
Create shadow
Optionally the filter can create a drop shadow which will have the same shape as the alpha channel. The shadow color is black and cannot be modified. Unless you don't plan to remove the background layer you should select a different Background color.
Neon with shadow
The filter uses two layers to achieve the neon effect
Chip Away inverted example
Inverted (without drop shadow)
If checked a Drop shadow will be added to the image in a new layer below the active layer.
Fill BG with pattern
If checked the background layer (added by the filter) will be filled with the specified Pattern. Otherwise it will be filled with white.

When checked the original not enlarged alpha of the outline layer will be filled with the specified pattern using the overlay mode so that the pattern and the previous contents (pattern or gradient) will be merged.
Again clicking on Browse button will open a patterns dialog pressing the preview icon will produce a popup preview of the current pattern.
The color of the background layer added by the filter. When you click on the color button a color select dialog pops up.
Optionally the filter creates a layer containing a drop shadow. The shadow layer will be moved Shadow X offset pixels to the right and Shadow Y offset pixels down. Note that this may enlarge the image while the background layer will keep the size of the active layer.
The numerous options may give the impression that this is a very complicate filter but actually it is fairly simple. The interesting part is how the filter handles the active layer and the outline layer

A Voronoi's diagram consists in partitioning a plane with n master points into n polygons where each polygon has only one of these n master points and where any given other point of the polygon is closer to the master point than to any other. So each polygon limit is midway between two master point. Here is an example of a Voronoi's diagram  Here when this option is checked only the vector closest to a given point of the image influences this point.
Direction of the selected vector. This slider has the same action as right-clicking (see above).
This slider allows you to change the angle of all vectors.
This slider acts on the influence domain of the selected vector. This influence lowers with distance. Strength is showed with the vector length.
This slider acts on the length of all vectors and so changes the strength of all brush strokes.
Filter Cubism applied
The Cubism plug-in modifies the image so that it appears to be constructed of small squares of semitransparent tissue paper.
If setting possibilities of this filter are not enough for you see GIMPressionist filter which offers more options.
Cubism filter options
This variable determines the size in pixels of the squares to be used. This is in effect the size of the little squares of tissue paper used in generating the new image. The slider can be used the exact pixel size can be entered into the text box or the arrow buttons can be used.
In this tab you can set what the stroke color will be.
Color options
You can set the stroke color in two ways
Stroke color is computed from the average of all pixels under the brush.
Samples the color from the pixel in the center of the brush.

If you only want to blur the image a little bit — to soften it as it were — you might use the simple "Blur" filter. This filter runs automatically without creating a dialog. The effect is subtle enough that you might not even notice it but you can get a stronger effect by repeating it. In GIMP 2.0 the filter shows a dialog that allows you to set a "repeat count". If you want a strong blurring effect this filter is too slow to be a good choice use a Gaussian blur instead.
Selective blur
The Selective Blur filter allows you to set a threshold so that only pixels that are similar to each other are blurred together. It is often useful as a tool for reducing graininess in photos without blurring sharp edges. (In the example note that the graininess of the background has been reduced.) The implementation is much slower than a Gaussian blur though so you should not use it unless you really need the selectivity.
The Pixelize filter produces the well-known "Abraham Lincoln" effect by turning the image into a set of large square pixels. (The Oilify filter in the Artistic Filters group has a similar effect but with irregular blobs instead of perfectly square pixels.)

Depth Merge is a Combine Filter which is useful to combine two different pictures or layers. You can decide which part of every image or layer will stay visible.
Filter example
Filter applied
This filter works with two images source and target. The source image must be a grayscale image containing a single layer and no Alpha channel. This layer is used as selection mask and will work as stencil for the carving effect. The image to be carved (the target image) can be an RGB color or grayscale image also with a single layer. This target image must have the same size as the source image.
This filter is found in the image window menu under FiltersDecorStencil Carve.
If this command remains grayed out although the image is grayscale check for an Alpha channel and delete it.
Stencil Carve options
Here you may select the target image i.e. the image the carving effect is applied to. The drop-down list will show you a list of opened images which may be carved.

Proper halftoning does not need antialiasing the aim is to reduce the color depth after all! However since this plugin is mainly for special effects the results are displayed on screen rather than by a black/white printer. So it is often useful to apply a little anti-aliasing to simulate ink smearing on paper. If you do want to print the resulting image then set the antialising to 1 (ie off).

This filter widens and enhances bright areas of the active layer or selection.
For every image pixel it brings the pixel Value (luminosity) into line with the upper value (the brightest) of the 8 neighbouring pixels (3x3 matrix). So a bright pixel is added around bright areas. An isolated pixel on a brighter background will be deleted. A larger bright area will dilate by one pixel in all directions.
On complex images bright areas are widened and enhanced the same and somewhat pixellated.

This option determines the number of sparkles on your image. It indicates the percentage (0.0-1.0) of all possible sparkles that will be preserved.

The Semi-flatten filter helps those in need of a solution to anti-aliasing indexed images with transparency. The GIF indexed format supports complete transparency (0 or 255 alpha value) but not semi-transparency (1 - 254) semi-transparent pixels will be transformed to no transparency or complete transparency ruining anti-aliasing you applied to the logo you want to put onto your Web page.
Before applying the filter it's essential that you should know the background color of your Web page. Use the color-picker to determine the exact color which pops up as the Foreground color of the Toolbox. Invert FG/BG colors so that BG color is the same as Web background color.
Semi-flatten process will combine FG color to layer (logo) color proportionally to corresponding alpha values and will rebuild correct anti-aliasing. Completely transparent pixels will not take the color. Very transparent pixels will take a few color and weakly transparent will take much color.
You can access this filter in the image window menu through FiltersWebSemi-Flatten. It is available if your image holds an Alpha channel (see ). Otherwise it is greyed out.

Incremental paint mode
Incremental mode is a paint mode where each brush stroke is drawn directly on the active layer. When it is set each additional stroke of the brush increases the effect of the brush up to the maximum opacity for the brush.
If incremental mode is not set brush strokes are drawn on a canvas buffer which is then combined with the active layer. The maximum effect of a brush is then determined by the opacity and stroking with the brush repeatedly does not increase the effect beyond this limit.
The two images above were created using a brush with spacing set to 60 percent. The image on the left shows non-incremental painting and the image on the right shows the difference with incremental painting.
Y=R+G+B
The exact calculation is more complicated however since some aspects of the color perception of the human eye have to be taken into account. For example green is perceived to be lighter than red and this is perceived to be lighter than blue. Furthermore in some systems gamma correction of the basic color is first performed.
The chrominance signals and the color difference signals also contain the color information. They are formed by the difference of blue minus luma or red minus luma.

The Auto submenu contains operations which automatically adjust the distribution of colors in the active layer without requiring any input from the user. Several of these operations are actually implemented as plugins.
Activate submenu
You can access this submenu from the image window through ColorsAuto.
GIMP has several automatic commands for stretching the columns of the histogram for the color channels of the active layer. By pushing bright pixels to the right and dark pixels to the left they make bright pixels brighter and dark pixels darker which enhances the contrast in the layer.
Some of the commands stretch the three color channels equally so that the hues are not changed. Other commands stretch each of the color channels separately which changes the hues.
Linear and Logarithmic buttons
These buttons allow to choose the Linear or Logarithmic type of the histogram. You can also use the same options in Tool Options dialog. This grayed out histogram is not displayed by default.
Main Editing Area
The horizontal gradient it represents the input tonal scale. It too ranges from 0 (black) to 255 (white) from Shadows to Highlights. When you adjust the curve it splits up into two parts; the upper part then represents the tonal balance of the layer or selection.
The vertical gradient it represents the destination the output tonal scale. It ranges from 0 (black) to 255 (white) from Shadows to Highlights.
This option ensures that brightness of the active layer or selection is maintained. The Value of brightest pixels is not changed.

With the Align Visible Layers command you can very precisely position the visible layers (those marked with the eye icon). This degree of precision is especially useful when you are working on animations which typically have many small layers. Clicking on Align Visible Layers displays a dialog which allows you to choose how the layers should be aligned.
In GIMP 1.2 the default base for the alignment was the top visible layer in the stack. In GIMP 2 the default alignment base is the edge of the canvas. You can still align the image on the bottom layer of the stack even if it is invisible by checking Use the (invisible) bottom layer as the base in the dialog.

The Autocrop Image command removes the borders from an image. It searches the active layer for the largest possible border area that is all the same color and then crops this area from the image as if you had used the Crop tool.

The Zoom submenu contains various commands which affect the magnification of the image in the image window (zooming). Enlarging an image (zooming in) is useful if you need to work with high precision making pixel-level image modifications or precise selections. On the other hand reducing an image (zooming out) is handy for getting an overall impression of the image and seeing the results of changes which affect the entire image.

That means that when you stoke brush pressure and velocity are varying along the length of the stroke. Pressure starts with zero ramps up to full pressure and then ramps down again to no pressure. Velocity starts from zero and ramps up to full speed by the end of the stroke.
If you choose Image source you must tell GIMP which layer to use as the source by Ctrl-clicking on it before you can paint with the tool.
If you check Sample merged it's what you see (color made with all the layers of a multi-layer image) that's cloned. If it's unchecked only the selected layer is cloned. For more information see the glossary entry Sample Merge.
Clicking on the pattern symbol brings up the Patterns dialog which you can use to select the pattern to paint with. This option is only relevant if you are cloning from a Pattern source.
The Alignment mode defines the relation between the brush position and the source position.
In the following examples we will use a source image where the sample to be cloned will be taken and a destination image where the sample will be cloned (it could be a layer in the source image)
TO DO
By default the color is picked from the foreground color in the toolbox. However if the color is activated in the dynamics editor the color is instead collected from the active gradient.
Velocity (mouse) At slow speeds the color is collected from the right side of the gradient. As the speed increase the color is picked more and more from the left side of the gradient.
Direction (mouse) The direction determine where on the gradient the color is picked from. The effect seems to work a bit on random.
Random (mouse) The color is picked at random from the gradient.

The Blend tool in Toolbox
This tool fills the selected area with a gradient blend of the foreground and background colors by default but there are many options. To make a blend drag the cursor in the direction you want the gradient to go and release the mouse button when you feel you have the right position and size of your blend. The softness of the blend depends on how far you drag the cursor. The shorter the drag distance the sharper it will be.
There are an astonishing number of things you can do with this tool and the possibilities may seem a bit overwhelming at first. The two most important options you have are the Gradient and the Shape. Clicking the Gradient button in the tool options brings up a Gradient Select window allowing you to choose from among a variety of gradients supplied with GIMP; you can also construct and save custom gradients. Further information about gradients can be found in  and .
For Shape there are 11 options Linear Bilinear Radial Square Conical (symmetric) Conical (asymmetric) Shaped (angular) Shaped (spherical) Shaped (dimpled) Spiral (clockwise) and Spiral (counterclockwise); these are described in detail below. The Shaped options are the most interesting they cause the gradient to follow the shape of the selection boundary no matter how twisty it is. Unlike the other shapes Shaped gradients are not affected by the length or direction of the line you draw for them as well as every other type of gradient you are required to click inside the selection and move the mouse but a Shaped appears the same no matter where you click or how you move.

The Rectangle Selection tool is designed to select rectangular regions of the active layer it is the most basic of the selection tools but very commonly used. For information on selections and how they are used in GIMP see Selections; for information on features common to all selection tools see Selection Tools.
This tool is also used for rendering a rectangle on an image. To render a filled rectangle create a rectangular selection and then fill it using the Bucket Fill tool. To create a rectangular outline the simplest and most flexible approach is to create a rectangular selection and then stroke it.
You can access the Selection Tool in different ways
Auto Shrink example
Auto Shrink applied
Scissors tool
Intelligent Scissors tool icon in the Toolbox
Using Intelligent Scissors
GIMP switch to this option automatically when the cage outline is finished. Now you are able to drag the anchor points around in the image and even outside it to transform the picture. The transforming starts when you release the mouse button.
You can activate more than one anchor point by holding down the Shift key while clicking on the points. You can also select more points by holding down the mouse button while drawing a rectangle around the desired points.
If the transforming action results in empty areas these areas will be filled with color if this option is checked. It looks like the color is picked from the start pixel of the cage line.
Example for the Cage tool
When clicking on the cage icon in the toolbox the cage option is set to Create or adjust the cage. You are now able to draw a cage outline in the image by successively clicking around the area you want to transform. Click on the starting point to finish the selection. GIMP will then do some mathematics and activate the Deform the cage to deform the image to allow you to drag the points on the line to deform the cage and the image.
The Auto Shrink button will attempt to locate a border in the active layer from which to draw dimensions from. This option only works well with isolated objects contrasting sharply with background.
Example for Autoshrink
An image with a sharp limit in it and a crop rectangle.
After clicking the Autoshrink button the crop rectangle has been shrunk to fit the sharp limits.
This option works the same with Auto Shrink or not. It uses the pixel information from all visible layers rather than just from the active layer.

There are several commands for saving images. A list and information on how to use them can be found in the section covering the File Menu.
GIMP allows you to export the images you create in a wide variety of formats. It is important to realize that the only format capable of saving all of the information in an image including layers transparency etc. is GIMP's native XCF format. Every other format preserves some image properties and loses others. It is up to you to understand the capabilities of the format you choose.
Exporting an image does not modify the image itself so you do not lose anything by exporting. See Export file.
When you close an image (possibly by quitting GIMP) you are warned if the image is "dirty"; that is if it has been changed without subsequently being saved (an asterisk is in front of the image name).
Closing warning
Another reason to change the value is because it seems that GIMP runs too slowly while changing to other applications is fast this means that GIMP could use more memory without impairing the other applications. On the other hand if you get complaints from other applications about not having enough memory then it may benefit you to not let GIMP hog so much of it.
If you decided to use only RAM and GIMP runs slowly you could try increasing the value a bit but never to use also all the free swap. If the case is the contrary using both RAM and swap and you have problems about lack of resources then you should decrease the amount of RAM available to GIMP.
Another trick is to put the Swap Dir on a very fast disk or on a different disk than the one where most of your files reside. Spreading the operating system swap file over multiple disks is also a good way to speed things up in general. And of course you might have to buy more RAM or stop using lots of programs at the same time you can not expect to edit a poster on a computer with 16MB and be fast.
You can also check what memory requirements your images have. The larger the images and the number of undoes the more resources you need. This is another way to choose a number but it is only good if you always work with the same kind of images and thus the real requirements do not vary. It is also helpful to know if you will require more RAM and/or disk space.

In this training course we'll introduce you to the fundamentals of Scheme necessary to use Script-Fu and then build a handy script that you can add to your toolbox of scripts. The script prompts the user for some text then creates a new image sized perfectly to the text. We will then enhance the script to allow for a buffer of space around the text. We will conclude with a few suggestions for ways to ramp up your knowledge of Script-Fu.
This section as adapted from a tutorial written for the GIMP 1 User Manual by Mike Terry.
Getting Acquainted With Scheme
Let's Start Scheme'ing
The first thing to learn is that
Defining A List Using The list Function
To define a list composed of literals or previously declared variables use the list function
This will compose and return a list containing the values held by the variables a b and c. For example
This code creates the list (5 4 3 1 2 3).
Accessing Values In A List
Before we add text to the image we need to set the background and foreground colors so that the text appears in the color the user specified. We'll use the gimp-context-set-back/foreground functions
With the colors properly set let's now clean out the garbage currently in the image by filling the drawable with the background color
(gimp-drawable-fill theLayer BACKGROUND-FILL)
With the image cleared we're ready to add some text
Although a long function call it's fairly straightforward if you go over the parameters while looking at the function's entry in the DB Browser. Basically we're creating a new text layer and assigning it to the variable theText.
In our experience if your image has a color cast---too much red too much blue etc---the easiest way to correct it is to use the Levels tool adjusting levels individually on the red green and blue channels. If this doesn't work for you it might be worth your while to try the Color Balance tool or the Curves tool but these are much more difficult to use effectively. (They are very good for creating certain types of special effects though.)
Sometimes it is hard to tell whether you have adjusted colors adequately. A good objective technique is to find a point in the image that you know should be either white or a shade of gray. Activate the Color Picker tool (the eyedropper symbol in the Toolbox) and click on the aforesaid point this brings up the Color Picker dialog. If the colors are correctly adjusted then the red green and blue components of the reported color should all be equal; if not then you should see what sort of adjustment you need to make. This technique when well used allows even color-blind people to color-correct an image.
If your image is washed out---which can easily happen when you take pictures in bright light---try the Hue/Saturation tool which gives you three sliders to manipulate for Hue Lightness and Saturation. Raising the saturation will probably make the image look better. In same cases it is useful to adjust the lightness at the same time. ( Lightness here is similar to Brightness in the Brightness/Contrast tool except that they are formed from different combinations of the red green and blue channels.) The Hue/Saturation tool gives you the option of adjusting restricted subranges of colors (using the buttons at the top of the dialog) but if you want to get natural-looking colors in most cases you should avoid doing this.
Even if an image does not seemed washed out often you can increase its impact by pushing up the saturation a bit. Veterans of the film era sometimes call this trick Fujifying after Fujichrome film which is notorious for producing highly saturated prints.
When you take pictures in low light conditions in some cases you have the opposite problem too much saturation. In this case too the Hue/Saturation tool is a good one to use only by reducing the saturation instead of increasing it.
The dialog shows a new image with the first dot which indicates the start of the straight line. The dot has a black foreground color.
Create a starting point by clicking on the image display area with the left mouse button. Your canvas should look similar to .
The helpline
The screenshot shows the helpline which indicates how the finished line will look.
Now hold down the Shift button on your keyboard and move the mouse away from the starting point you created. You'll see a thin line indicating how the line will look.
If the image has a soft transition into the transparent areas you should not remove the alpha channel since the information used for the transition is not be saved in the file. To export an image with transparent areas that do not have a soft transition (similar to GIF) remove the alpha channel.
After you have flattened the image export the image in the PNG format for your web site.
You can export your image in the PNG format with the default settings. Always using maximum compression when creating the image. Maximum compression has no affect on image quality or the time required to display the image but it does take longer to export. A JPEG image however loses quality as the compression is increased. If your image is a photograph with lots of colors you should use jpeg. The main thing is to find the best tradeoff between quality and compression. You can find more information about this topic in .
Reducing the File Size Even More
If you want to reduce the size of your image a bit more you could convert your image to Indexed mode. That means that all of the colors will be reduced to only 256 values. Do not convert images with smooth color transitions or gradients to indexed mode because the original smooth gradients are typically converted into a series of bands. Indexed mode is not recommended for photographs because after the conversion they typically look coarse and grainy.
Voilà. Your brush is ready. Save it as .xcf first then as .gih with the following parameters

GIMP Help is supplied in the form of HTML files i. e. web pages. You can view them using either a special help browser that comes with GIMP or a web browser of your choice. Here you choose which option to use. Because the help pages were carefully checked to make sure they work well with GIMP's browser whereas other web browsers are somewhat variable in their support of features the safer option is to use the internal browser; but really any modern web browser should be okay.
Note that the GIMP help browser is not available on all platforms. If it is missing this option is hidden and the standard web browser will be used to read the help pages.

The “safe” value asks for confirmation in these cases but allows instant changes for booleans and nullable booleans enums and flags. The “always-confirm-implicit” and “always-confirm-explicit” values always asks for confirmation but the first applies the change if you change path whereas the second dismiss it. The “always-delay” value adds each change in delay mode allowing to apply multiple keys at once.

Be careful not to bury low cards. Try to keep Tableau piles from emptying.
Four piles top right. Built from Ace to King in suit.
Reserves
Four piles at top left. Each reserve can only hold one card.
Eight piles underneath the Foundation and Reserves. The cards are dealt face up on to the Tableau with seven cards each in the first four slots and six cards each in the last four slots.
Move all cards to the foundation piles.
Build foundations up in suit and tableau piles down in suit. If no moves are available (or you just feel like it) click on the empty top left slot for a redeal.
Redeals are accomplished by placing the tableau piles on top of each other in order starting from the last pile. Then the deck is simply turned over and redealt four cards at a time back to the tableau. If no moves are made redealing will not alter the arrangement of the cards. Therefore the game is lost if no move is possible immediately after a redeal.
Note a degenerate case occurs whenever after a redeal the last tableau pile contains only one card and the only move possible is from the final tableau pile one before it. Making this move and redealing only results in the original card arrangement. AisleRiot will end the game if this situation is detected.
Each card placed in the foundation piles scores one point.
Every card moved from the Tableau on top of a card in the Foundation scores one point.
Make sure to look at all the cards coming up and be sure you're not going to lock any cards that are necessary to move the one on top.
Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing on to the Tableau. Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste. No redeals
Deal face up seven overlapping rows starting with one card on the first row increasing by one per row and staggering the piles as to achieve a pyramid.
Cards are flipped singly from the Stock to the Waste. There is no redeal.
Four piles on top to the right of Stock. Place an Ace on the first pile a two on the second pile a three on the third pile and a four on the fourth pile. The first Foundation pile is built up by one the second is built up by two the third by three and the fourth by four all of which wrap around to Ace when it reaches past thirteen. cards in Foundations are no longer in play. Suits do not matter.
Four piles placed underneath Foundations. Cards in Reserve can only be played on to Foundation piles. Cards moved from Waste can be placed on any of the Reserve piles.
Build on to Foundations by ones twos threes and fours for piles one two three and four respectively. Cards are dealt singly in to the Waste from the Stock. However as the Waste pile can only hold one card this card must immediately be played on to a Foundation pile or on to any of the four Reserve piles. Cards in the Reserve piles cannot be rearranged.
Each card moved to Foundations scores one point.
Hone your skills for this game. Luck will not get you very far here. Try not to cover cards you might need sooner. Consider saving a column just for kings (as they are the last card to be played on each Foundation).
Click on Kings to remove them. All other cards can be removed in pairs that add up to thirteen as long as the two cards are touching horizontally vertically or diagonally.
Remove cards higher up on the table first as this creates more movement within the grid.
Four piles on left. To be built up in suit from Ace to King.
Seven piles. Deal three rows face down followed by three rows face up. Then deal two more rows face up in the middle five piles.
Cards in the Tableau are built down by suit. Groups of cards can be moved regardless of sequence. Groups of cards in sequence can be moved into an appropriate and receptive Foundation pile. An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with a King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom.
Try to keep a Tableau pile empty whenever possible to create a swap space for moving around cards.
Top left pile. Deck placed here after dealing onto Tableau. Clicking deals one card face up to every pile.
Top eight piles. Only used to hold sequences of cards going down from King down to Ace once completed.
Ten piles. Four piles (piles 1 4 7 and 10) get dealt 5 cards down and one card up while rest of the piles get dealt 4 cards down and one card up. Cards can be built down regardless of suit. Sequences of cards in the same suit can be moved as a unit. Empty piles can be filled with any card or movable unit.

Higher resolution generally means better quality images but photos and videos with higher resolution take up more space on your hard disk. High resolution videos in particular take up a lot of space.
If you want your images to take up less disk space reduce the resolution of your webcam. If you want better quality images increase the resolution. To change the webcam resolution
Choose a different resolution from the drop-down list. Some webcams only support one resolution so you may not have a choice.
Use your webcam to record short movies for sharing with friends.

Introduction to the GNOME Archive Manager.
Archive Manager is an application for managing archive files for example .zip or .tar files; it is designed to be easy to use. Archive Manager provides all the tools that are necessary for creating modifying and extracting archives.
An archive consists of one or more files and folders along with metadata. It may be encrypted in part or as a whole. Archive files are useful for storing data and transferring it between computers as they allow you to collect multiple files into one.
With Archive Manager you can
create a new archive
Chooser - A program used to select a remote host for managing a display remotely on the attached display (gdm-host-chooser).
FreeDesktop - The organization providing desktop standards such as the Desktop Entry Specification used by GDM.  http//www.freedesktop.org.
GDM - GNOME Display Manager. Used to describe the software package as a whole.
Greeter - The graphical login window (provided by gnome-shell).
PAM - Pluggable Authentication Mechanism
When GDM is about to create a new login process for a user it will call a privileged method of ConsoleKit in order to open a new session for this user. At this time GDM also provides ConsoleKit with information about this user session such as the user ID the X11 Display name that will be associated with the session the host-name from which the session originates (useful in the case of an XDMCP session) whether or not this session is attached etc. As the entity that initiates the user process GDM is in a unique position to know about the user session and to be trusted to provide these bits of information. The use of this privileged method is restricted by the use of the D-Bus system message bus security policy.
In case a user with an existing session has authenticated at GDM and requests to resume that existing session GDM calls a privileged method of ConsoleKit to unlock that session. The exact details of what happens when the session receives this unlock signal are undefined and session-specific. However most sessions will unlock a screensaver in response.
When the user chooses to log out or if GDM or the session quit unexpectedly the user session will be unregistered from ConsoleKit.
GDM has a number of configuration interfaces. These include scripting integration points daemon configuration greeter configuration general session settings integration with gnome-settings-daemon configuration and session configuration. These types of integration are described in detail below.
Scripting Integration Points
MaxWaitIndirect
MaxWaitIndirect=30
The MaxWaitIndirect parameter determines the maximum number of seconds between the time where a user chooses a host and the subsequent indirect query where the user is connected to the host. When the timeout is exceeded the information about the chosen host is forgotten and the indirect slot freed up for other displays. The information may be forgotten earlier if there are more hosts trying to send indirect queries then MaxPendingIndirect.
PingIntervalSeconds
PingIntervalSeconds=60
Also make sure that the /tmp directory has reasonable ownership and permissions and that the machine's file system is not full. These problems will cause GDM to fail to start.

Switch Hover Click to ON.
The Hover Click window will open and will stay above all of your other windows. You can use this to choose what sort of click should happen when you hover. For example if you select Secondary Click you will right-click when you hover. After you double-click right-click or drag you will be automatically returned to clicking.
When you hover your mouse pointer over a button and do not move it it will gradually change color. When it has fully changed color the button will be clicked.
Adjust the Delay setting to change how long you have to hold the mouse pointer still before clicking.
You do not need to hold the mouse perfectly still when hovering to click. The pointer is allowed to move a little bit and will still click after a while. If it moves too much however the click will not happen.

Sharing color profiles is never a good idea as hardware changes over time.
Can I share my color profile?
Color profiles that you have created yourself are specific to the hardware and lighting conditions that you calibrated for. A display that has been powered for a few hundred hours is going to have a very different color profile to a similar display with the next serial number that has been lit for a thousand hours.
This means if you share your color profile with somebody you might be getting them closer to calibration but it’s misleading at best to say that their display is calibrated.
Similarly unless everyone has recommended controlled lighting (no sunlight from windows black walls daylight bulbs etc.) in a room where viewing and editing images takes place sharing a profile that you created in your own specific lighting conditions doesn’t make a lot of sense.
If there is no available application for the detail that you wish to use you will not be able to select it.

Check if a filesystem is damaged and bring it back into a usable state.
Repair a damaged filesystem
Filesystems can be corrupted due to unexpected power loss system crashes and unsafe removal of the drive. After such an incident it is recommended to repair or at least check the filesystem to prevent future data loss.
Sometimes a repair is required in order to mount or modify a filesystem. Even if a check does not report any damage the filesystem might still be marked as ‘dirty’ internally and require a repair.
Check if a filesystem is damaged
These instructions apply to both files and folders. You copy and move files and folders in exactly the same way.
Copy and paste files
Select the file you want to copy by clicking on it once.
Right-click and pick Copy or press CtrlC.
Navigate to another folder where you want to put the copy of the file.
Safely remove an external drive
When you use external storage devices like USB flash drives you should safely remove them before unplugging them. If you just unplug a device you run the risk of unplugging while an application is still using it. This could result in some of your files being lost or damaged. When you use an optical disc like a CD or DVD you can use the same steps to eject the disc from your computer.
To eject a removable device
From the Activities overview open Files.
Locate the device in the sidebar. It should have a small eject icon next to the name. Click the eject icon to safely remove or eject the device.

The keypad is a set of numerical buttons on your keyboard usually arranged into a square grid. If you have a keyboard without a keypad (such as a laptop keyboard) you may need to hold down the function (Fn) key and use certain other keys on your keyboard as a keypad. If you use this feature often on a laptop you can purchase external USB or Bluetooth numeric keypads.
Each number on the keypad corresponds to a direction. For example pressing 8 will move the pointer upwards and pressing 2 will move it downwards. Press the 5 key to click once with the mouse or quickly press it twice to double-click.
Most keyboards have a special key which allows you to right-click sometimes called the Menu key. Note however that this key responds to where your keyboard focus is not where your mouse pointer is. See  for information on how to right-click by holding down 5 or the left mouse button.
If you want to use the keypad to type numbers while mouse keys is enabled turn Num Lock on. The mouse cannot be controlled with the keypad when Num Lock is turned on though.
The normal number keys in a line at the top of the keyboard will not control the mouse pointer. Only the keypad number keys can be used.
View and edit files on another computer over FTP SSH Windows shares or WebDAV.
Browse files on a server or network share
You can connect to a server or network share to browse and view files on that server exactly as if they were on your own computer. This is a convenient way to download or upload files on the internet or to share files with other people on your local network.
To browse files over the network open the Files application from the Activities overview and click Other Locations in the sidebar. The file manager will find any computers on your local area network that advertize their ability to serve files. If you want to connect to a server on the internet or if you do not see the computer you’re looking for you can manually connect to a server by typing in its internet/network address.

You may need to install Flash to be able to view websites like YouTube which display videos and interactive web pages.
Install the Flash plug-in
Flash is a plug-in for your web browser that allows you to watch videos and use interactive web pages on some websites. Some websites won’t work without Flash.
If you do not have Flash installed you will probably see a message telling you so when you visit a website that needs it. Flash is available as a free (but not open-source) download for most web browsers. Most Linux distributions have a version of Flash that you can install through their software installer (package manager) too.
If Flash is available from the software installer
Web browser has a problem
Sometimes web browsers encounter a problem that makes them run slow. This could be for any number of reasons — you could have visited a website that the browser struggled to load or you might have had the browser open for a long time for example. Try closing all of the browser’s windows and then opening the browser again to see if this makes a difference.
Set up a VPN connection to a local network over the internet.
Connect to a VPN
A VPN (or Virtual Private Network) is a way of connecting to a local network over the internet. For example say you want to connect to the local network at your workplace while you’re on a business trip. You would find an internet connection somewhere (like at a hotel) and then connect to your workplace’s VPN. It would be as if you were directly connected to the network at work but the actual network connection would be through the hotel’s internet connection. VPN connections are usually encrypted to prevent people from accessing the local network you’re connecting to without logging in.
Some device drivers don’t work very well with certain wireless adapters so you may need to find a better one.
Wireless network troubleshooter
Make sure that working device drivers are installed
In this step you can check to see if you can get working device drivers for your wireless adapter. A device driver is a piece of software which tells the computer how to make a hardware device work properly. Even though the wireless adapter has been recognized by the computer it may not have drivers which work very well. You may be able to find different drivers for the wireless adapter which do work. Try some of the options below
Check to see if your wireless adapter is on a list of supported devices.
In order to estimate the remaining battery life a number of factors must be taken into account. One is the amount of power currently being used by the computer power consumption varies depending on how many programs you have open which devices are plugged in and whether you are running any intensive tasks (like watching high-definition video or converting music files for example). This changes from moment to moment and is difficult to predict.
Another factor is how the battery discharges. Some batteries lose charge faster the emptier they get. Without precise knowledge of how the battery discharges only a rough estimate of remaining battery life can be made.
As the battery discharges the power manager will figure out its discharge properties and will learn how to make better estimates of battery life. They will never be completely accurate though.
If you get a completely ridiculous battery life estimate (say hundreds of days) the power manager is probably missing some of the data it needs to make a sensible estimate.
If you unplug the power and run the laptop on battery for a while then plug it in and let it recharge again the power manager should be able to get the data it needs.
Suspend sends your computer to sleep so it uses less power.
What happens when I suspend my computer?
When you suspend the computer you send it to sleep. All of your applications and documents remain open but the screen and other parts of the computer switch off to save power. The computer is still switched on though and it will still be using a small amount of power. You can wake it up by pressing a key or clicking the mouse. If that does not work try pressing the power button.
Some computers have problems with hardware support which mean that they may not be able to suspend properly. It is a good idea to test suspend on your computer to see if it does work before relying on it.
Always save your work before suspending

The way that they are protected is by only allowing users with administrative privileges to change the files or use the applications. In day-to-day use you will not need to change any system files or use these applications so by default you do not have administrative privileges.
Sometimes you need to use these applications so you may be able to temporarily get administrative privileges to allow you to make the changes. If an application needs administrative privileges it will ask for your password. For example if you want to install some new software the software installer (package manager) will ask for your administrator password so it can add the new application to the system. Once it has finished your administrative privileges will be taken away again.
Administrative privileges are associated with your user account. Administrator users are allowed to have these privileges while Standard users are not. Without administrative privileges you will not be able to install software. Some user accounts (for example the “root” account) have permanent administrative privileges. You should not use administrative privileges all of the time because you might accidentally change something you did not intend to (like delete a needed system file for example).
In summary administrative privileges allow you to change important parts of your system when needed but prevent you from doing it accidentally.

Bookmarks to accessible items in Accerciser are defined by an application name and a "path" in the application's internal accessible hierarchy to the bookmarked accessible. When the target application is in a different state - i.e. multiple top level frames - the path might not be correct. Bookmarks could be managed by accessing the bookmark editing dialog through BookmarksEdit Bookmarks.

If you find Dasher hard to imagine based on these static pictures please take a look at the movies on http//www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/.
Tips for novices
Don't give up if it takes you a minute or two to get started - within ten minutes you'll be blazing along. It's a lot like driving a car. You should start by driving cautiously. If you can't tell where you are going stop going. Indeed you will probably learn Dasher fastest if you come to it with car-driving analogies in mind rather than standard computer analogies. For example the way navigation works is not by DRAGGING but by STEERING if cars worked like windows computers you would have to grab the piece of road you want then drag; it towards you; but in a car when you wish to drive right you POINT RIGHT with your steering wheel. Dasher does not work by dragging either. Do not try to grab things and drag them. Just decide where you want to go and point there.
The single most important concept that a novice user needs to understand is that one should always continue inside the text written so far to select the book that contains all; as its first word one does not enter the a; section of the library then exit the ;a; section and enter the l; section. One enters the a; section then finds the al; section that is within the a; section then enters the all; section within the al; section.
It's just like finding a name in a phonebook. To find Alison; you don't go to the A; section of the phonebook then the ;L; section you go into the A; section then find within it the Al; section and so forth. Once you are in the Al; section you never leave it.
How many different switches keys or buttons can you easily operate?
With just one button the only timeless way to convey information is by the duration of your button-presses. Can you make a distinction between short presses and long presses? If so you can use menu button-Dasher. Connect up your short press to the `menu' action and your long press to the `select' action.
You can use menu button-Dasher. Connect one button to the `menu' action and the other to the `select' action. If one button is easier to press make that button the `menu' button.
2.5
If you can easily press two buttons and for special occasions you are able to press a third button you can use menu button-Dasher or direct button-Dasher.

The configuration of Ekiga is now completed. The last window only shows a short configuration summary of the settings you have chosen. Please verify that all these settings are correct. If something is incorrect you may use the 'Back' button in the lower right hand corner of the window to move to any page of the assistant and correct the mistake.
If everything is correct please press the 'Apply' button to save the configuration. The assistant will be closed and the main Window of Ekiga will now appear. Remember all settings can be changed via the preferences window at anytime.
You can adjust the delay to wait before playing the sound buffers that you have received using the jitter buffer adjustment. If there is too much packet loss the delay required to have received all packets could be so important that it will exceed the jitter buffer. In such a case the sound you are receiving will be of bad quality. A solution to that problem would be to increase the maximum limit of the jitter buffer to a few seconds resulting in a big delay but in an improved voice quality. Notice that the jitter buffer will readapt itself to the lowest delay allowing for optimum transmission and that a bad voice quality in reception is not due to a too low jitter buffer value but to bad internet connection quality.
Changing Ports
The listen ports
The main port used to listen for incoming connections in Ekiga for SIP is port 5060 (UDP) while 1720 (TCP) is used by H.323. To change those ports you need to load "gconf-editor". Open gconf-editor select apps from the left hand side menu and then select Ekiga Protocols. Then select "sip" or "h323" it should give you a list in the corresponding window to your right. Select listenport and change it to your desired value. You can also change the UDP/RTP port ranges.

Chat rooms
Some instant messaging applications can be used to connect to chat rooms online places where like-minded people meet to talk. One popular means to connect to several chat rooms is the Internet Relay Chat also known as IRC. IRC provides public chat rooms which are open to anyone who creates an account on the IRC Server and private chat rooms which are password protected and open only to a select few.
Browse or search your previous conversations.
From the Contact List window do one of the following
Select the contact you want to share your desktop with and choose EditContact Share My Desktop.

History-based auto completion function
Command Line uses the history-based auto completion function to complete commands in the entry field. This function compares the contents of the entry field with the history list. If Command Line finds a match then the applet completes the command. See the note in  for more information.
User-requestable command completion function
This command completion function compares character strings in the entry field with commands in the user path. The command completion function is useful if you do not know the exact character sequence or spelling of a command. After you type the first few letters of the command name press the Tab key. If Command Line recognizes the character sequence as unique then the applet completes the command name. See  for more information.

Importing files using drag and drop
The concept of drag and drop is a well-established method of bridging the gap between software applications. Simply select the files you want to import in another application (such as a file manager or a multimedia app) and drag them with your mouse onto Pitivi's Media Library.
This feature can be used to
Easily import music or video clips from a media player (such as Rhythmbox or Totem).
Allow using a full-fledged file manager (such as Nautilus Thunar Dolphin or Konqueror) instead of the file chooser dialog.
You may sometimes find that you have imported more clips that you needed in your project. Pitivi allows you to select clips that are present in the media library but not in the timeline. There are various reasons to do this
Improving performance when loading the project
Simplifying your editing workflow
Check which clips you may have forgot to use in your movie
Backup or share your project more easily
Click on the Split button on the timeline toolbar or press S.
Only the clips under the playhead can be split depending on the current selection
If clips are selected only the selected clips under the playhead are split.
If the selection is empty all the clips under the playhead are split.
See how to select clips in Selection and grouping.
Alternatively you can use the Search Bar that is shown at the top of the Effect Library. Typing into the search entry filters the contents of the Effect Library to show only effects whose name or description match your search terms. To reset the search entry click the Clear icon in the search entry.
Configuring effects
To configure an effect simply select it in the middle paneClip configurationEffects. The properties that can be adjusted will appear below in the same tab. Each variable can be put back to its original value by clicking the corresponding Reset to default value button.
Animating effects with keyframes
The effect properties which can be controlled using keyframe curves have a Show keyframes for this property button. When you click it the keyframe curves on the clip start controlling the respective property. You can now edit the keyframes to achieve the desired effect. Once you are done with editing you can click the button again and the keyframe curve disappears from the clip. However the effect property is still controlled by the adjusted keyframe curve (which is indicated by the filled shape on the button).
Voice Lossless (WAV audio)
The Voice output profile produces low-quality mono audio files. You may wish to select this for lectures books on tape and other spoken word CDs where the loss in audio quality is less important.
The MP3 audio format is a lossy format. It is widely supported and popular especially because of its use for portable media players.
You can click the Edit Profiles button to edit the available audio formats. The profile editor dialog provides direct access to the audio conversion. Profiles are defined with GStreamer pipelines. GStreamer is the underlying multimedia library used by Sound Juicer and other multimedia applications. A full explanation of audio profiles is outside the scope of this document.

Setting Your Preferencesquot;Edit gt; Preferencesquot; lets you modify a number of settings such as the path to your media files and allows you to adjust many aspects of the Gramps presentation to your needs. Each separate view can also be configured under quot;View gt; Configure Viewquot;
Gramps ReportsGramps offers a wide variety of reports. The Graphical Reports and Graphs can present complex relationships easily and the Text Reports are particularly useful if you want to send the results of your family tree to members of the family via email. If you're ready to make a website for your family tree then there's a report for that as well.
Starting a New Family TreeA good way to start a new family tree is to enter all the members of the family into the database using the Person View (use quot;Edit gt; Addquot; or click on the Add a new person button from the People View). Then go to the Relationship View and create relationships between people.
What's That For?Unsure what a button does? Simply hold the mouse over a button and a tooltip will appear.
Unsure of a Date?If you're unsure about the date an event occurred Gramps allows you to enter a wide range of date formats based on a guess or an estimate. For instance quot;about 1908quot; is a valid entry for a birth date in Gramps. Click the Date button next to the date field and see the Gramps Manual to learn more.

The [print$] share must exist on the Samba side prior to clicking the Export button below.
 Brightness Slider to control the brightness value of all colors used. The brightness value can range from 0 to 200. Values greater than 100 will lighten the print. Values less than 100 will darken the print.    Additional hint for power users This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter     -o brightness=      # use range from "0" to "200"   
 Hue (Tint) Slider to control the hue value for color rotation. The hue value is a number from -360 to 360 and represents the color hue rotation. The following table summarizes the change you will see for the base colors   Original hue=-45 hue=45    Red             Purple         Yellow-orange    Green           Yellow-green   Blue-green       Yellow          Orange         Green-yellow     Blue            Sky-blue       Purple           Magenta         Indigo         Crimson          Cyan            Blue-green     Light-navy-blue      Additional hint for power users This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter     -o hue=     # use range from "-360" to "360"   
  Saturation Slider to control the saturation value for all colors used.  The saturation value adjusts the saturation of the colors in an image similar to the color knob on your television. The color saturation value can range from 0 to 200. On inkjet printers a higher saturation value uses more ink. On laserjet printers a higher saturation uses more toner. A color saturation of 0 produces a black-and-white print while a value of 200 will make the colors extremely intense.   Additional hint for power users This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds  to the CUPS command line job option parameter     -o saturation=      # use range from "0" to "200"   
  Gamma Slider to control the gamma value for color correction.  The gamma value can range from 1 to 3000. A gamma value greater than 1000 lightens the print. A gamma value less than 1000 darkens the print. The default gamma is 1000.  Note the gamma value adjustment is not visible in the thumbnail preview.    Additional hint for power users This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter     -o gamma=      # use range from "1" to "3000"

This plugin provides various options for hist or plot.histogram.
This plugin is mostly used as an embedded plugin. All the GUI elements here set various parameters to either hist or plot.histogram functions. For parameter specific help see the respective R references. Few parameter combinations might not produce any sensible plot so read the R references to make a judicious choice of parameters.
Check this box if the histogram is to be added to the current plot. This is the add parameter.

To fit the linear logistic test model with default settings just the matrix of manifest variables (dichotomous item responses) must be selected. Further options are described in the sections below. For detailed information on the expected layout of matrices and vectors please refer to the manual for the LLTM() function.
If repeated measurement applies specify how many are represented in the data matrix (defaults to 1). This will divide the columns in the matrix into equally sized subsets of data.
If you want to compute group contrasts a vector determining the group membership of each subject must be given. By default no group contrasts are imposed.
By default the design matrix for the LLTM will be computed automatically. Alternatively you may specify your own design matrix here.
By default eta values start with the 0-vector. To change this a vector of starting values can be specified.

Using the output in an office suite
One of the many goals of RKWard is to have easy integration with an office-suite. Right now output is simply stored in HTML format (including images as png) of your results. HTML can be read and worked on with any modern office suite.
The easiest way to get output into your office suite is to first select the relevant portions copy them (Edit->Copy) then paste them. This works well at least in OpenOffice. You can also drag and drop images from the output to an OpenOffice document.

PulseAudio is a sound server for POSIX and Win32 systems. A sound server is basically a proxy for your sound applications. It allows you to do advanced operations on your sound data as it passes between your application and your hardware. Things like transferring the audio to a different machine changing the sample format or channel count and mixing several sounds into one are easily achieved using a sound server.

KDE Applications 4.11 Bring Huge Step Forward in Personal Information Management and Improvements All Over
Games and educational applications
KDE's game and educational applications have received many updates in this release. KDE's jigsaw puzzle application Palapeli has gained nifty new features that make solving large puzzles (up to 10000 pieces) much easier for those who are up to the challenge. KNavalBattle shows enemy ship positions after the game ends so that you can see where you went wrong.
KDE's Educational applications have gained new features. KStars gains a scripting interface via D-BUS and can use the astrometry.net web services API to optimize memory usage. Cantor has gained syntax highlighting in its script editor and its Scilab and Python 2 backends are now supported in the editor. Educational mapping and navigation tool Marble now includes the positions of the Sun Moon and planets and enables capturing movies during virtual tours. Bicycle routing is improved with the addition of cyclestreets.net support. Nautical miles are now supported and clicking a Geo URI will now open Marble.

KDE Ships First Beta of Applications and Platform 4.14
March 6 2015. Today KDE released the beta of the new versions of KDE Applications. With dependency and feature freezes in place the KDE team's focus is now on fixing bugs and further polishing.
With the various applications being based on KDE Frameworks 5 the KDE Applications 15.04 releases need a thorough testing in order to maintain and improve the quality and user experience. Actual users are critical to maintaining high KDE quality because developers simply cannot test every possible configuration. We're counting on you to help find bugs early so they can be squashed before the final release. Please consider joining the team by installing the beta and reporting any bugs.
Installing KDE Applications 15.04 Beta1 Binary Packages
Some Linux/UNIX OS vendors have kindly provided binary packages of KDE Applications 15.04 Beta1 (internally 15.03.80) for some versions of their distribution and in other cases community volunteers have done so. Additional binary packages as well as updates to the packages now available may become available over the coming weeks.

The application now adapts better to high resolution screens.
The context menu now includes more useful options allowing you to sort and change the view mode directly.
Sorting by modification time is now 12 times faster.
Also you can now launch Dolphin again when logged in using the root user account. Support for modifying root-owned files when running Dolphin as a normal user is still work in progress.

KArchive offers support for many popular compression codecs in a self-contained featureful and easy-to-use file archiving and extracting library. Just feed it files; there is no need to reinvent an archiving function in your Qt-based application! ThreadWeaver offers a high-level API to manage threads using job- and queue-based interfaces. It allows easy scheduling of thread execution by specifying dependencies between the threads and executing them while satisfying these dependencies greatly simplifying the use of multiple threads. These are available for production use now.
There is a full list of the Frameworks; tarballs with the current code can be downloaded. Binaries are available as well.
Overview of the KDE Frameworks (a work in progress!)
The team is currently working on providing a detailed listing of all Frameworks and third party libraries at inqlude.org the curated archive of Qt libraries. Each entry includes a dependency tree view. Dependency diagrams can also be found here.

Plasma 5.11 Beta
Thursday 14 Sep 2017.
Today KDE publishes a testing release of this autumn's Plasma feature release KDE Plasma 5.11 to be released in mid-October 2017. Plasma 5.11 will bring a redesigned settings app improved notifications a more powerful task manager. Plasma 5.11 will be the first release to contain the new “Vault” a system to allow the user to encrypt and open sets of documents in a secure and user-friendly way making Plasma an excellent choice for people dealing with private and confidential information.
Plasma on Wayland cares about your vision so an exclusive Wayland-only feature called Night Color is also available. Night Color integrates with KWin and removes blue light from your screen at night-time functioning as an equivalent of the great Redshift app that works on X.
We have also started implementing window rules on Wayland and made it possible to use real-time scheduling policy to keep the input responsive. XWayland is no longer required to run the Plasma desktop; however the applications only supporting X still make use of it.
There is also an important change of policy 5.12 is the last release which sees feature development in KWin on X11. With 5.13 onwards only new features relevant to Wayland are going to be added.
We have put a lot of work into making Wayland support in Plasma as good as possible but there are still some missing features and issues with particular hardware configurations. Therefore we don't yet recommend it for daily use. More information is available on the  Wayland status wiki page.

Collected training data will be compiled in an adaption matrix which will then be applied to the selected base model.
This type of model does require the model creation backend to be installed.
When using user-generated models the user is responsible for training his own model. No base model will be used.
The training data will be used to compile your own acoustic model allowing you to create a system which directly reflects your voice.

To help Simon with the automatic segmentation it is recommended to leave about one or two seconds of silence on the recording before and after reading the prompted text.
The switch to apply filters to recordings recorded with Simon enables the postprocessing chains for samples recorded during the training (including the initial training while adding the word). If you don't select this switch the postprocessing commands are only applied to imported samples (through the import training data wizard).
Every sample recorded with Simon is assigned a sample group.
When creating the acoustic model from the training samples Simon can take the current situation into account to only use a subset of all gathered training data.
Sound Configuration Context
For example in a system where multiple very different speakers use one shared setup context conditions can be set up to automatically build separate models for both users depending on the current situation.
To add a new scenario you first create a new scenario "shell" by adding a new scenario object and then open it in the kmyapplication; main window.
To instead modify an existing scenario you of course just have to open it.
A kmyapplication; scenario contains the following components
Training texts
Before describing how to configure these elements in Simon the next section provides background information that will help you understand the basic principles of speech modelling. This fundamental knowledge is necessary to design sensible scenarios.
The category of the word is defined as the grammatical category the word belongs to. This might be Noun Verb or completely new categories like Command. For more information see the grammar section.
The list contains all categories used in both your active and your shadow lexicon and in your grammar.
You can add new categories to the drop-down menu by using the green plus sign next to it.
Manually Providing the Phonetic Transcription
The pronunciation is a bit trickier. Simon does not need a certain type of phonetics so you are free to use any method as long as it uses only ASCII characters and no numbers. However if you want to use a shadow dictionary and want to use it to its full potential you should use the same phonetics as the shadow dictionary.
Import Grammar Text file
Import Grammar Select files
Simon will then read the entered text or all the given text files (in this case the only given text file is simongrammar.txt) and look up every single word in both active and shadow dictionary (the definition in the active dictionary has more importance if the word is available in both). It will then replace the word with its category.
In our example this would mean that he would find the sentence Computer Internet. Simon would find out that Computer is of the category Trigger and Internet of the category Command. Because of this Simon would learn that Trigger Command is a valid sentence and add it to its grammar.
The import automatically segments the input text by punctuation marks (. - ! etc;) so any natural text should work. The importer will automatically merge duplicate sentence structures (even across different files) and add multiple sentence (all possible combinations) when a word has multiple categories assigned to it.
Using the factory workers abstraction from above it could be compared to stating the name of who you mean to process your request. So instead of Open my home folder you say Joe open my home folder and Joe (the plugin responsible for opening folders) will instantly know that the request is meant for him.
In practice you could have commands like the executable command Firefox to open the popular browser and the place command Google to open the web search engine. If you assign the trigger Start to the executable plugin and the trigger Open to the place command you would have to say Start Firefox (instead of just Firefox if you don't use a trigger for the executable plugin) and Open Google to open the search engine (instead of just Google).
Triggers are of course no requirement and you can easily use Simon without defining any plugin triggers (although many plugins come with a default trigger of Computer set which you would have to remove). But even if you use just one trigger for all your commands (like Computer to say Computer Firefox and Computer Google like) it has the advantage of greatly limiting the number of false-positives.
Simon's command dialog displays the complete phrase associated with a command in the upper right corner of the command configuration.
You can load multiple instances of one plugin even in one scenario. Each instance can of course also have a different plugin trigger.
Using the input-number plugin the user can input large numbers easily.
Using the Dictation or the Text-Macro plugin one could associate the numbers with their digits and use that as input method. However to input larger numbers there are two ways that both have significant disadvantages
Adding the words eleven twelve etc;
While this seems like the most elegant solution as it would enable the user to say fivehundredseventytwo we can easily see that it would be quite a problem to add all these words - let alone train them. What about twothousandninehundredtwo? Where to stop?
Spell out the number using the individual digits
To use an avatar first add it here and later define where to use it in the dialog design section.
Dialogs can be displayed graphically use text-to-speech or combine both approaches.
Dialog Output
The Separator to options will be spoken between the dialog text and the current state's options (if there are any). If there are no options to this state or all are configured to be silent this will not be said. The option to listen to the whole announcement again is triggered when saying one of the configured Repeat on trigger. Additionally the text-to-speech output can optionally be configured to repeat the listing of the available options (including the configured separator) when the user says a command that does not match any of the available dialog options.
The Akonadi plugin allows kmyapplication; to plug into KDE's PIM infrastructure.
The user reads the text from the screen. In practice the facilitator can read it out for the user to repeat as well.
During the interview the facilitator asks the user a couple of questions and record the answers.
Setting up training material
Before you can use SSC you will likely want to adjust the training prompts for the recordings.
They are three one for each training type simple text files containing one line per prompt. The encoding is UTF-8.

When viewing a document in the Structure view you can jump between elements by clicking on the element you would like to view.
Inverse Search
The forward search functions allow you to jump from your editor directly to the associated position of the DVI; or PDF file.
kile; offers a configuration with this option for all latex; binaries. Go to SettingsConfigure Kile ToolsBuild and always choose the Modern configuration.
To execute a forward search position the cursor on a line of source code and click Forward Search to jump to the associated position in the DVI; or PDF viewer window.
Inverse Search between kile; and okular;
Inverse search is a very useful feature when you are writing a latex; document yourself. If everything is set up properly you can click into okular;'s window with the left mouse button while pressing Shift;. After that kile; loads the latex; source file and jumps to the proper paragraph. To use inverse search you have to compile your latex; file with the Modern configuration.
Ctrl;Alt;T T TeX Group (inside)
Delete a tex; group inside the surrounding braces.
Ctrl;Alt;T U TeX Group (outside)
Delete a tex; group including the surrounding braces.
Ctrl;Alt;T M Math Group
Define how many shortened lines of the text are set alongside the figure. If you leave this empty latex; will determine this itself as well as is possible.
Define an overhang to the chosen side. This is especially useful when you have columns in your document and you want a figure to span over more than just one column or you want shortened text on both sides of the figure.
Choose a width for the figure. This should be a bit bigger than the actual image width so there will be some empty space between the figure and the text.
Arrays and tabulars
One of the most boring jobs one can do in latex; is to write a matrix or a tabular environment. One has to keep track of all the elements ensure that the environment is well formed and that all things are where they are supposed to be. Good indentation helps but there is a simpler way using kile;'s WizardArray or WizardTabular menu entries. You will then have a matrix-style input form that you can easily fill in with your entries. This dialog also offers some options to typeset the tabular material.
Put one page and a duplicate together on one A4 page.
Duplicate a page
If the page to be duplicated has A4 size it will be scaled to fit on the page.
2 pages --> A4
Combine two consecutive pages together on one A4 page. Whenever two A5 pages are combined together they are rotated by 90 degrees and arranged on an A4 page in landscape mode.
XeLaTeX+PDF (embedded viewer)
XeLaTeX+PDF (okular;)
This should be sufficient for all situations for which a quick preview is needed.
Environment Mode
Very often you want to preview the current environment and especially mathematical environments which sometimes may be difficult to write. kile; offers a very fast way to do this. No selection is needed just choose BuildQuickPreviewEnvironment or the keyboard shortcut Ctrl;Alt;PE and the current environment will be compiled and shown.
If you want to create a new main file of the project check the Create a new file and add it to this project item.
When you fill out the Filename box you have to include a relative path from where the .kilepr project file is stored (see the Project folder item).
Type of the created file Empty File Article Book Letter Report etc; can be chosen from a visual list at the bottom of the File panel.
Extensions for the default files in the project can be selected using the Extensions panel. Your choice will be used to define the files that should be opened when you choose ProjectOpen All Project Files menu item and in the kile; wizards. The extensions in the text field should be separated with spaces.
The Files and Projects View
Use a keyboard shortcut.
Scripting keyboard shortcut
You can assign a keyboard shortcut to a script using the Configure button in the script management widget.
Scripting configure sequence dialog
Use an editor key sequence. The script will be executed if you type the assigned key sequence in the editor.
int view.cursorColumn();
Returns the column which the cursor is currently located at.
void view.setCursorLine(int line);
Set the cursor line to the given line.
void view.setCursorColumn(int column);
Returns the last character in the given line that is not a whitespace. If the line is empty or only contains whitespace characters the returned string is empty.
Returns true if the character at the given cursor position is a whitespace otherwise false.
void document.insertBullet();
Insert a kile; bullet. Remember that you can easily jump to the next or previous bullet. This will also highlight this bullet so that it will be deleted automatically when you enter your first letter.
void document.nextBullet();
Insert a \footnote command.
void document.comment();
Inserts comment markers to make the selection or current line a comment.
void document.uncomment();
Removes comment markers from the selection or current line.
Surround selected text with a TeX command where the relative cursor position will not be changed. abc for example can be changed to \texcommand{abc}.
User-Configurable Menu
kile; supports a user-configurable menu which will appear as a part of kile;'s menu. This menu can be configured using kile;'s configuration dialog with SettingsConfigure KileUser Menu.
Configure the user menu
You have two options where to place this menu

Sequence Diagram

Activity Diagram
In Sequence Diagrams objects are represented through vertical dashed lines with the name of the Object on the top. The time axis is also vertical increasing downwards so that messages are sent from one Object to another in the form of arrows with the operation and parameters name.
umbrello; showing a Sequence Diagram
Messages can be either synchronous the normal type of message call where control is passed to the called object until that method has finished running or asynchronous where control is passed back directly to the calling object. Synchronous messages have a vertical box on the side of the called object to show the flow of program control.
Collaboration Diagrams
Collaboration Diagrams show the interactions occurring between the objects participating in a specific situation. This is more or less the same information shown by Sequence Diagrams but there the emphasis is put on how the interactions occur in time while the Collaboration Diagrams put the relationships between the objects and their topology in the foreground.
Using the context menu of the different items in the Tree View you are able to add remove and modify almost all the elements in your model. Right clicking on the folders in the Tree View will give you options for creating the different types of diagrams as well as depending on whether the folder is a Use Case View or a Logical View Actors Use Cases Classes etc.
Once you have added elements to your model you can also edit an element by accessing its properties dialog which you find by selecting the option Properties from the context menu shown when right clicking on the items in the Tree View.
You can also edit your model by creating or modifying elements through diagrams. More details on how to do this are given in the following sections.
Adding and Removing Diagrams
Your UML; model consists of a set of UML; elements and associations between them. However you cannot see the model directly you use Diagrams to look at it.

The dialog to enter a new value for the address of another CUPS; server to accept browse packets from is shown here.

Browse allow and Browse deny
Browse allow specifies an address mask to allow for incoming browser packets. The default is to allow packets from all addresses.
Browse deny specifies an address mask to deny for incoming browser packets. The default is to deny packets from no addresses.
Allowing or denying printer access for certain users
When installing (or modifying) a printer through the command line you can either deny or allow the usage of that printer to certain users
lpadmin -pHeidelbergDigimaster9110 -v lpd/10.160.16.99/mqueue -u allowkurtsylvihansjoerg -E -P /home/kurt/PPDs/DVHV.ppd
will allow the usage of this (believe me very nice and also very professional) printer to only the three mentioned users and at the same time deny it to all others. If another user wants to print on the DigiMaster via this CUPS; server he will receive an error message along the lines client-error-not-possible.
lpadmin -p HeidelbergDigimaster9110 -v lpd/10.160.16.99/mqueue -u denytackatbosswaba -E -P /home/kurt/PPDs/DVHV.ppd
Module For External Print Command (Netscape;-like)
This module allows the print command to be specified completely (Netscape;-like). An edit line is added in the print dialog for that purpose. Can be used in many cases for example with a self-made print program.
Printer management not supported
Job management not supported.
Print options basic control depending on your knowledge of the print command
For duplexing printers make sure you use the duplex option that turns the output along the short paper edge. Folding the printed paper along the middle turns your document into a nice pamphlet.
If you are stuck with using a simplex-only device you can do the same using two different filters and a few additional steps.
Depending on your model first use the filter for printing the odd pages then insert the paper in the correct order back into the paper tray to get the even pages printed on the reverse side. These can then be folded to make a pamphlet.
CUPS; Support the Most Important Module in kdeprint;
kdeprint; contains a module for CUPS;. CUPS; the Common UNIX; Printing System (http//www.cups.org/) is the most advanced powerful and flexible of all print subsystems on UNIX; and other UNIX;-like operating systems. It is still quite new on the horizon but is based on IPP the Internet Printing Protocol the newly emerging standard for the future of network printing. CUPS; is clearly the print system of choice for Michael Goffioul the principal kdeprint; developer.
Earlier on in history every developer of a program that was capable of producing printable output had to write his own printer drivers too. That was quite complicated because different programs have different file formats. Even programs with the same purpose for example word processors often do not understand each other's formats. There was therefore no common interface to all printers hence the programmers often supported only a few selected models.
A new device appearing on the market required the program authors to write a new driver if they wanted their program to support it. Also for manufacturers it was impossible to make sure their device was supported by any program known to the world (although there were far fewer than today).
Having to support ten application programs and a dozen printers meant a system administrator had to deal with 120 drivers. So the development of unified interfaces between programs and printers became an urgent need.
The appearance of Page Description Languages describing the graphical representation of ink and toner on sheets of paper (or other output devices like monitors photo typesetters etc;) in a common way was a move that filled a big gap.
One such development was PostScript; by Adobe. It meant that an application programmer could concentrate on making his program generate a PostScript; language description of his printable page while printing device developers could focus on making their devices PostScript; literate.
Valid syntax is either print/[path-to-virtual-folder] or print[path-to-virtual-folder]
Note that some of the views and actions offered do heavily depend on the print subsystem that is installed on your box and presently activated for kde;. Pages showing printer information display only those parts that are valid for the kde; selected print subsystem. (So if you normally run CUPS but switched temporarily to Generic UNIX LPD Printing which is possible you will see less printer info because LPD is not capable of using the same amount of print settings as are possible in CUPS).

DECSEX(1.6668) returns 140
DECSEX(7.8) returns 747
The SEXDEC() function returns a decimal value. You can also supply a time value.
The HOUR functions returns the hour of a time. If no parameter is specified the current hour gets returned.
HOUR(time)
HOUR("221012") returns 22
HOUR(0.1285) returns 3
The MINUTE functions returns the minutes of a time. If no parameter is specified the current minute is returned.
DATEDIF(first date; second date; interval)

The YEARFRAC() function returns the number of full days between start date and end date according to the basis.
Basis must be one of the following 0 = 30/360 US 1 = Actual/actual 2 = Actual/360 3 = Actual/365 4 = European 30/360
The BIN2HEX() function returns the value formatted as a hexadecimal number.
BIN2HEX(value)
BIN2HEX("1010") returns "a"

The SLN() function will determine the straight line depreciation of an asset for a single period. Cost is the amount you paid for the asset. Salvage is the value of the asset at the end of the period. Life is the number of periods over which the asset is depreciated. SLN divides the cost evenly over the life of an asset.
ISERR(x)
The ISERROR() function returns True if its parameter is an error of any type. Otherwise it returns False.
ISERROR(x)
The ISNA() function returns True if its parameter is a N/A error. In all other cases it returns False.

The TRUNC() function truncates a numeric value to a certain precision. If the precision is omitted 0 is assumed.
TRUNC(value; precision)
TRUNC(1.2) returns 1
TRUNC(213.232; 2) returns 213.23
The ODD() function returns the number rounded up (or down for negative values) to the nearest odd integer. By definition ODD(0) is 1.
MINA(0.4; 2; FALSE; 0.7) returns 0.
The MULTIPLY() function multiplies all the values given in the parameters. You can multiply values given by a range MULTIPLY(A1B5) or a list of values like MULTIPLY(12;5;12.5). It's equivalent to PRODUCT.
MULTIPLY(value;value;)
MULTIPLY(12;5;7) equals 420
MULTIPLY(12.5;2) equals 25
RANDNORM(0; 1)
Bottom value
Top value
The RANDBETWEEN() function returns a pseudo-random number between bottom and top value. If bottom > top this function returns Err.
RANDBETWEEN(bottom;top)
INDEX(A1;2;2) if A1 is a result of array calculation returns its (22) element.
Returns the content of the cell specified by the reference text. The second parameter is optional.
INDIRECT(referenceText a1 style)
INDIRECT(A1) A1 contains "B1" and B1 1 => returns 1
INDIRECT("A1") returns content of A1
CORREL(range1; range2)
CORREL(A1A3; B1B3)
The COVAR() function calculates the covariance of two cell ranges.
COVAR(range1; range2)
COVAR(A1A3; B1B3)
The MEDIAN() function calculates the median of all the values given as parameters. You can calculate the median of a range like MEDIAN(A1B5) or a list of values like MEDIAN(12; 5; 12.5). Blank cells will be considered as a zero and cells with text will be ignored.
MEDIAN(value;value;)
MEDIAN(12; 5; 5.5) equals 5.5
MEDIAN(12; 7; 8;2) equals 7.5
The MODE() function returns the most frequently occurring value in the data set.
STDEVP(6;7;8) equals 0.816497
The STDEVPA() function returns standard deviation based on an entire population. If a referenced cell contains text or contains the boolean value FALSE it is counted as 0. If the boolean value is TRUE it is counted as 1.
STDEVPA(value;value;)
STDEVPA(6; 7; A1; 8) equals 0.816497 if A1 is empty
STDEVPA(6; 7; A1; 8) equals 2.69 if A1 is TRUE
DOLLAR(1403.77) returns "$ 1403.77"
DOLLAR(-0.123;4) returns "$-0.1230"
Nocommas
The FIXED() function rounds a number to the specified number of decimals formats the number in decimal format string and returns the result as text. If decimals is negative number is rounded to the left of the decimal point. If you omit decimals it is assumed to be 2. If optional parameter nocommas is True thousand separators will not show up.
FIXED(number;decimals;nocommas)
The RIGHT() function returns a substring that contains the 'length' rightmost characters of the string. The whole string is returned if 'length' exceeds the length of the string.
RIGHT(text;length)
RIGHT("hello";2) returns "lo"
RIGHT("KSpread";10) returns "KSpread"
RIGHT("KSpread") returns "d"
The ASIN() function returns the arc sine in radians and the value is mathematically defined to be -PI/2 to PI/2 (inclusive).
ASIN(Float)
ASIN(0.8) equals 0.92729522
ASIN(0) equals 0
The ATAN() function returns the arc tangent in radians and the value is mathematically defined to be -PI/2 to PI/2 (inclusive).

Open the Find Object dialog so that you can select an object to get an RA and DEC automatically that you would like the telescope to slew to when doing the mount model routine.
Sort the alignment points starting with the point closest to the current telescope position to try to minimize the distance between each slew.
This is a table of alignment points that you would like the mount model routine to use in aligning your telescope.  If you would like to add or remove points you may use the buttons above.  If you would like to run pause or stop the mount model routine you may use the buttons below.  You can directly edit an RA or DE for a particular point directly in the cells.  Just be sure to follow the format hhmmss. The object name is just provided for convenience and is not used.  If you want to change the order of the alignment points you can drag the row up or down using the vertical header for that row on the left.

KPhotoAlbum is capable of backing up the index.xml file by keeping copies named index.xml1 index.xml2 etc. and you can use the spinbox to specify the number of backup files to keep. KPhotoAlbum will delete the oldest backup file when it reaches the maximum number of backup files.The index.xml file may grow substantially if you have many images and in that case it is useful to ask KPhotoAlbum to zip the backup files to preserve disk space.
KPhotoAlbum is using a single index.xml file as its data base. With lots of images it may take a long time to read this file. You may cut down this time to approximately half by checking this check box. The disadvantage is that the index.xml file is less readable by human eyes.

Really reorder thumbnails?By dragging images around in the thumbnail viewer you actually reorder them. This is very useful where you do not know the exact date for the images. On the other hand if the images have valid timestamps you should use Maintenance -gt; Sort All By Date and Time or View -gt; Sort Selected By Date and Time.

To avoid possible copyright infringement issues I used 'LargeRGB' (following RawTherapee) as the base name for these profiles.Kodak designed the RIMM/ROMM (ProPhotoRGB) color gamut to include all printable and most real world colors. It includes some imaginary colors and excludes some of the real world blues and violet blues that can be captured by digital cameras. It also excludes some very saturated 'camera-captured' yellows as interpreted by some (and probably many) camera matrix input profiles.The ProPhotoRGB primaries are hard-coded into Adobe products such as Lightroom and the Dng-DCP camera 'profiles'. However other than being large enough to hold a lot of colors ProPhotoRGB has no particular merit as an RGB working space. Personally and for most editing purposes I recommend BetaRGB Rec2020 or the ACEScg profiles ProPhotoRGB.
Rec.2020 is the up-and-coming replacement for the thoroughly outdated sRGB color space. As of June 2015 very few (if any) display devices (and certainly no affordable display devices) can display all of Rec.2020. However display technology is closing in on Rec.2020 movies are already being made for Rec.2020 and various cameras offer support for Rec.2020. And in the digital darkroom Rec.2020 is much more suitable as a general RGB working space than the exceedingly small sRGB color space.
Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft designed sRGB to match the color gamut of consumer-grade CRTs from the 1990s. sRGB is the standard color space for the world wide web and is still the best choice for exporting images to the internet.The sRGB color gamut was a good match to calibrated decent quality CRTs. But sRGB is not a good match to many consumer-grade LCD monitors which often cannot display the more saturated sRGB blues and magentas (the good news as technology progresses wider gamuts are trickling down to consumer grade monitors).Printer color gamuts can easily exceed the sRGB color gamut in cyans greens and yellow-greens. Colors from interpolated camera raw files also often exceed the sRGB color gamut.As a very relevant aside using perceptual intent when converting to sRGB does not magically makes otherwise out of gamut colors fit inside the sRGB color gamut! The standard sRGB color space (along with all the other the RGB profiles provided in my profile pack) is a matrix profile and matrix profiles don't have perceptual intent tables.
To avoid possible copyright infringement issues I used 'WideRGB' as the base name for these profiles.WideGamutRGB was designed by Adobe to be a wide gamut color space that uses spectral colors as its primaries. Pascale's primary values produce a profile that matches old V2 Widegamut profiles from Adobe and Canon. It is an interesting color space but shortly after its introduction Adobe switched their emphasis to the ProPhotoRGB color space.
These profiles are for use with RGB images that have been converted to monotone gray (black and white). The main reason to convert from RGB to Gray is to save the file space needed to encode the image. Google places a premium on fast-loading web pages and images are one of the slower-loading elements of a web page. So converting black and white images to Grayscale images does save some kilobytes.  For grayscale images uploaded to the internet convert the image to the V2 Gray profile with the sRGB TRC.

Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) is a patented lossy codec for digital audio.AAC generally achieves better sound quality than MP3 at similar bit rates. It is a reasonable choice for the iPod and some other portable music players.
Apple Lossless
Apple Lossless (ALAC) is an audio codec for lossless compression of digital music.Recommended only for Apple music players and players that do not support FLAC.
The compression level is an integer value between 0 and 8 that represents the tradeoff between file size and compression speed while encoding with FLAC. Setting the compression level to 0 yields the shortest compression time but generates a comparably big fileOn the other hand a compression level of 8 makes compression quite slow but produces the smallest file.Note that since FLAC is by definition a lossless codec the audio quality of the output is exactly the same regardless of the compression level.Also levels above 5 dramatically increase compression time but create an only slightly smaller file and are not recommended.
Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) is an open and royalty-free codec for lossless compression of digital music.If you wish to store your music without compromising on audio quality FLAC is an excellent choice.
If checked overwrite files of the same name without asking.
Overwrite Destination
Character Replacement
If checked convert spaces to underscores.
If checked all spaces will be replaced with underscores in the file names. If not spaces will be left as they are.

The format of the dates in the QIF file.
If a QIF file contains date entries with years represented with two digits then either an apostrophe or a slash may be used to delimit the year in the dates for certain centuries.  This enables 1905 to be distinguished from 2005.  Specify here which range of years will have year delimited by an apostrophe (eg. for Quicken this is usually 1900-1949).

CookiesCookies contain information that KDE applications using the HTTP protocol (like Konqueror) store on your computer initiated by a remote Internet server. This means that a web server can store information about you and your browsing activities on your machine for later use. You might consider this an invasion of privacy. However cookies are useful in certain situations. For example they are often used by Internet shops so you can 'put things into a shopping basket'. Some sites require you have a browser that supports cookies. Because most people want a compromise between privacy and the benefits cookies offer the HTTP kioslave offers you the ability to customize the way it handles cookies. So you might want to set the default policy to ask you whenever a server wants to set a cookie allowing you to decide. For your favorite shopping web sites that you trust you might want to set the policy to accept then you can access the web sites without being prompted every time a cookie is received.

Configure enhanced browsing features
Enhanced Browsing In this module you can configure some enhanced browsing features of KDE. Web ShortcutsWeb Shortcuts are a quick way of using Web search engines. For example type "duckduckgofrobozz" or "ddfrobozz" and your web browser will do a search on DuckDuckGo for "frobozz". Even easier just press Alt+F2 (if you have not changed this keyboard shortcut) and enter the shortcut in the Run Command dialog.

A mortar is used for manually grinding solids. It can also be used to homogenize a mixture of powders by grinding. A club-shaped tool known as a pestle is used with the mortar for grinding.
Heating Coil
Heating coils are used to heat flasks and other containers. Multiple heating coils can be connected with a thermometer so that the heat will not exceed a specified temperature. It is possible to use a magnetic field inside the heating coil to stir fluids with a magnetic stirrer. This will homogenize the fluid in terms of temperature and composition.
Cork Ring
Large containers like round-bottomed flasks are placed on rings made of cork a special soft lightweight wood with good insulating qualities to protect fragile instruments.
Argon
Greek 'aergon' for 'inactive'
Potassium
The name comes from the English 'potash' ('pot ashes') because it is found in caustic potashes. The symbol comes from the Latin 'kalium' for the original Arabic 'al qaliy' which means alkali.
Calcium
Named after the Roman name 'Lutetia' for Paris
Hafnium
Niels Bohr originally predicted the properties of this element before discovery so it was named after his hometown of 'Hafnia' (the old Latin name of Copenhagen Denmark)
Tantalum
Named after the Greek myth of Tantalos

Get In And Up
After you reach the first ladder go down and wait for the enemies to run towards you. When they are nearly upon you run up go left and enter the building. Take the two pieces of gold and dig yourself through.
No Way Out
You have to dig before you take the gold and before the ladders appear.
Get the gold in the middle and on the top before getting the gold on the bottom or lower left.  That way if you have to kill an enemy (the one at the left is just asking for it) then they only block your way to the exit rather than make it impossible to gather the remaining gold.

Data ModeData tracks may be written in two different modesAutoLet K3b select the best suited data mode.Mode 1This is the original writing mode as introduced in the Yellow Book standard. It is the preferred mode when writing pure data CDs.Mode 2To be exact XA Mode 2 Form 1 but since the other modes are rarely used it is common to refer to it as Mode 2.Be aware Do not mix different modes on one CD. Some older drives may have problems reading mode 1 multisession CDs.
Install cdrdao >= 1.1.8 which supports writing to ATAPI devices directly.
K3b will not be able to write DVD-R Dual Layer media using a growisofs version older than 6.0.
Install a more recent version of growisofs.
With most modern CD/DVD/BD devices enabling DMA highly increases read/write performance. If you experience very low writing speeds this is probably the cause.
Sometimes it may be necessary to specify user parameters in addition to the parameters generated by K3b. This is simply a warning to make sure that these parameters are really wanted and will not be part of some bug report.

Only mono and stereo files can be used for an audio CD. You can either deselect some channels or export the file in a different file format that supports mono and stereo only (for example FLAC) and then try again.
Buffer sizeSelect a buffer size for the playback. You should set this number as small as possible to reduce the playback latency. The latency is the delay between user interface actions like starting/stopping playback update of the playback position and the real sound output. If you encounter dropouts you should increase this setting a bit.

AbstractCard
An AbstractCard is the simplest form of card. It's just a rectangle with a shadow which can contain any Item in it. It can also have items assigned to the Header or Footer properties. In this case a Kirigami.Heading is its header and a Label with WordWrap is the contentItem.
This option does not always produce the right result. Due to this expansion Kompare may have problems applying the change to the destination file.
This option corresponds to the -B diff option.
This can be very useful in situations where code has been reorganized and empty lines have been added or removed to improve legibility.
This option corresponds to the -b diff option.
If you are uninterested in differences arising due to for example changes in indentation then use this option.
internationalism a term that has the same or nearly identical orthographic or phonemic form in many languages
logical expression an expression used to represent a concept based on mathematical or logical relations such as statements of inequality set relationships Boolean operations and the like
materials management unit a unit to track object
near synonym a term that represents the same or a very similar concept as another term in the same language but for which interchangeability is limited to some contexts and inapplicable in others

OpenPGP Certificate Refresh
Refreshing OpenPGP certificates implies downloading all certificates anew to check if any of them have been revoked in the meantime.This can put a severe strain on your own as well as other people's network connections and can take up to an hour or more to complete depending on your network connection and the number of certificates to check. Are you sure you want to continue?

Valgrind Generic Settings
Display stack to depth
Specifies the maximum number of entries shown in stack traces that identify program locations. Note that errors are commoned up using only the top four function locations (the place in the current function and that of its three immediate callers). So this doesn't affect the total number of errors reported.The maximum value for this is 500. Note that higher settings will make Valgrind run a bit more slowly and take a bit more memory but can be useful when working with programs with deeply-nested call chains.
Maximum size of a stack frame
The maximum size of a stack frame. If the stack pointer moves by more than this amount then Valgrind will assume that the program is switching to a different stack.You may need to use this option if your program has large stack-allocated arrays. Valgrind keeps track of your program's stack pointer. If it changes by more than the threshold amount Valgrind assumes your program is switching to a different stack and Memcheck behaves differently than it would for a stack pointer change smaller than the threshold. Usually this heuristic works well. However if your program allocates large structures on the stack this heuristic will be fooled and Memcheck will subsequently report large numbers of invalid stack accesses. This option allows you to change the threshold to a different value.You should only consider use of this option if Valgrind's debug output directs you to do so. In that case it will tell you the new threshold you should specify.In general allocating large structures on the stack is a bad idea because you can easily run out of stack space especially on systems with limited memory or which expect to support large numbers of threads each with a small stack and also because the error checking performed by Memcheck is more effective for heap-allocated data than for stack-allocated data. If you have to use this option you may wish to consider rewriting your code to allocate on the heap rather than on the stack.

The dolphin; View
Using the View
The view displays all files and folders in the current folder. These items can be accessed or manipulated in different ways
A file or folder can be opened by clicking it with the LMB; (or double-clicking if Double-click to open files and folders is enabled in the systemsettings; in the Input Devices Mouse module.
Clicking any item or the white area around the items with the RMB; opens a context menu which provides access to many frequently used actions for the item or the current folder respectively.
dolphin; is capable of renaming a number of files at the same time. Each file will have the file name specified including a number eg; Image1.jpg Image2.jpg Image3.jpg. This can be useful eg; for pictures taken with a digital camera.
If you wish to rename a batch of files first select the files to be renamed. This can be done by pressing the LMB; and drawing a rectangle around the files to be renamed before releasing it or by holding Ctrl; and clicking each file to be renamed (see Selecting Items in the View for more details on item selection). Then open the batch-rename dialog by pressing F2 or via the File menu  File Rename 
Then enter the name you wish to give the files. The # character must be present within the name. The files will then be renamed where the # character is replaced by a different consecutive number for each file.
If all file extensions in your selection are different the name of all files can be changed without using a # placeholder while preserving the file extensions. This is eg; useful to rename a video file and all associated subtitle files which have the same filename but different extensions.
Comparing A Selection Of Files or Folders
If Use these view properties as default is enabled the chosen view properties will also be used for all folders which do not have customized view properties yet.
By default the menubar is not shown. All actions described here either can be accessed with toolbar buttons or with items in the menu of the Control toolbar button.

Regular - the default. Text is displayed without any special appearance.
Bold Italic - a combination of both Bold and Italic
Bold - this displays text in a darker thicker fashion and is commonly used for titles of documents or to emphasize text.
This is the rightmost selection box and lets you select the size of your text. Font size is measured in points a standard unit of measure in typography. For more information on this see the Point (typography) article on Wikipedia.
The bottom of the font selector displays a preview of text using the font settings that are currently selected. You may change this text if you wish.
These appear at the top of an area of a window and permit that area of the window to be changed to a variety of different selections.
Allows a large amount of text to be typed in typically multiple lines or paragraphs. Unlike a Text Box pressing Enter; will usually result in a line break.
A single-line text entry that allows a small amount of text to be typed in. Typically pressing Enter; will perform the same action as clicking the OK button.
This is located at the top of every window. It contains the name of the application and usually information about what the application is doing like the title of the web page being viewed in a web browser or the filename of a document open in a word processor.
These are located near the top of many applications typically directly underneath the menu bar. They provide access to many common functions of the running application like Save or Print.

Optional attributes
mimetype associates files MIME; type.
An order followed by an exclamation mark (!) and an identifier which will make the engine first follow the order and then switch to the other context e.g. #pop#pop!OtherContext.
Some rules can have child rules which are then evaluated only if the parent rule matched. The entire matched string will be given the attribute defined by the parent rule. A rule with child rules looks like this
Rule specific attributes varies and are described in the following sections.
Common attributes
All rules have the following attributes in common and are available whenever (common attributes) appears. attribute and context are required attributes all others are optional.
You can switch contexts without processing characters. Assume that you want to switch context when you meet the string */ but need to process that string in the next context. The below rule will match and the lookAhead attribute will cause the highlighter to keep the matched string for the next context.
lt;Detect2Chars attribute=quot;Commentquot; context=quot;#popquot; char=quot;*quot; char1=quot;/quot; lookAhead=quot;truequot; /gt;
Use DetectSpaces if you know that many whitespaces occur.
Use DetectIdentifier instead of the regular expression '[a-zA-Z]\w*'.
Use default styles whenever you can. This way the user will find a familiar environment.

Missing Features

Enabling Allow automatic delayed reloading/redirecting allows websites to send you to another page without your interaction. In many cases this is a convenience. For example the website has moved to a new URL;. Many webmasters in this situation will put up a page on the old site telling you that it has moved and you may like to change your bookmark and then automatically move you along to the new website. However such features can be confusing or annoying when misused and so you may wish to disable it.
Enable Access Key activation with Ctrl; key Pressing the Ctrl; key when viewing web pages activates Access Keys. Unchecking this box will disable this accessibility feature. konqueror; needs to be restarted for this change to take effect.
Send the DNT header to tell web sites you do not want to be tracked. Check this box if you want to inform a web site that you do not want to your web browsing habits tracked.
Offer to save website passwords. Uncheck this box from being prompted to save website passwords
General konqueror; Behavior
OpenOffice.org Calc / LibreOffice Calc
If you enable this option kfind; will only find text in files with the exact case matching eg; MARC will only match MARC not Marc.
If you have installed the kregexpeditor; tool from playground/utils on the kde; git server you will have this additional option. Enabling it will allow you to search for a regexp or regular expression. A regexp is a way to specify conditions for your search and they can be very complex and equally they can be very powerful. If you are unfamiliar with regular expressions you can choose Edit button to open kregexpeditor;. This tool allows you to construct your set of conditions graphically and then generates the expression for you.
kregexpeditor; is a very useful tool and can be used from within many kde; applications other than kfind;. You can find more information from within its own help file.
The Properties Tab
Prev amp; Next are used to move to the previous/next page at the current level of the hierarchy.
Clicking on a menu item within a document moves you to a lower level in the hierarchy. You may move up the hierarchy by pressing Up.
Man is treated similarly to info with the section index being the Top node and each man page on the level below. Man entries are one page long.
The kde; glossary
The glossary provides a quick reference point where you can look up the definitions of words that may be unfamiliar to you. These range from kde; specific applications and technologies through to general UNIX; computing terms.
konqueror; decides what the file type is by matching the filename extension against a list of known types. If that fails it tries to guess the type from the file contents. You can change the list of known file types and associated actions with the File Associations page of the SettingsConfigure Konqueror  dialog.
Clicking the MMB; on a file or folder name or icon does essentially the same as left clicking except that it usually does it in a new konqueror; window unless the Open links in new tab instead of in new window box has been checked in the General page of the SettingsConfigure Konqueror dialog. konqueror; can open links on pages and Bookmarks as well as the Home Up Back and Forward entries in a new tab or window.
Holding the Shift; key down while pressing the MMB; will open the link in the background.
Right Mouse Button Menus
Clicking the RMB; on almost any part of konqueror;'s window will bring up an appropriate context menu.
If you use konqueror; tabs you can drag and drop between tabs by dragging the file to the tab label without letting go yet. The destination tab will pop to the front allowing you to continue dragging and then to drop the file.
Duplicate File or Folder Names
If you try to paste a file or folder into a folder that already contains an item with the same name konqueror; will pop up a dialog box warning you that the item already exists. You can then choose to
Cancel the paste operation by pressing the Cancel button.
Give the item that is being copied a different name. You can do this by typing a new name into the text entry box or get konqueror; to Suggest New Name. When you have done this press the Continue button.
To overcome this problem you can change the browser identification information that konqueror; sends for specific sites or domains by selecting the Browser Identification module in the systemsettings; category Network.
Problems with getting a web page to work properly may also be due to its use of Java; or JavaScript. If you suspect that this may be the case check that they have been enabled in the Java amp; JavaScript section of the settings dialog.
Saving and Printing Web Items
When you are viewing a web page you can save it (or at least the basic HTML; or similar source text) to your local disk with FileSave As. If the page you are viewing uses frames then you will also be given the FileSave Frame As option. Left click in the frame you want to save first.
If the page uses a background image you can get and save that with the FileSave Background Image As option.
The Folders dialog is used for choosing where to save the gallery. This dialog is also used to configure which folders are used.

kwrite; is a text editor by kde; allowing you to edit one file at the time per window.
kwrite; is more than a text editor by kde;. It is meant to be a programmer's editor and could be considered as at least a partial alternative to more powerful editors. It may be best used in conjunction with konqueror; or dolphin; for source file browsing for different languages. kwrite; also works very well as a simple text editor. One of kwrite;'s main features is the colorized syntax customized for many different programming languages such as C/C++ Java; Python Perl Bash Modula 2 HTML; and Ada. kwrite; has a single document interface (SDI) allowing you to edit one file at the time per window.
kwrite; is a simple interface to the katepart; component also used by kate; KDevelop and other applications from kde; that require advanced text editing. Therefore complete documentation for all the features of kwrite; can be found in the katepart; Handbook.
Though kwrite; may most often be started from the plasma; application starter or a desktop icon it can also be opened at the command line prompt of a terminal window. There are a few useful options that are available when doing this.

Opening an existing Kexi database file by clicking on .kexi file's iconnbsp;
Using built-in helpnbsp;
Kexi Databases
Many applications such as OpenOffice.org LibreOffice or Microsoft; Excel create files which are called documents. kexi; creates files too but we refer to them as kexi; database files or simple database files here.
In addition to storing your databases in database files kexi; can also use databases on database servers which is why we refer to them as database files and not simply as databases.
Enter data into tables. Read the section called Entering Data Into Tables.
Design database queries. Read the section called Designing Database Queries.
Design forms. Read the section called Designing Forms.
Use forms to enter data. Read the section called Entering Data Using Forms.
Designing Database Tables
Giving widgets reasonable names can be useful but is not mandatory. Note that widget's name is a property that is not visible to the user of your form. Users will only see a widget text provided by Text property or similar.
Inserting widgets - text fields
Let's create a form providing information about persons ie; a form connected it with Persons table.
If the form being designed should present data obtained from the database you need to place appropriate fields on it. To do this use the buttons on the Widgets toolbar. Each button corresponds to a single widget type.
Click Text Box button on the Widgets toolbar.
This action closes the kexi; project you have currently open.
Here you can follow the wizard to create a new kexi; Project.
Here you can follow the wizard to Import existing data to the currently open kexi; Project.
Closes kexi;.
The Create Tab
Data redundancy
This is directly connected to the previous problem. In fields Name and surname and Address the same data is entered many times. This is typical of a spreadsheets' ineffective way of storing data because the database grows unnecessarily thus requiring more computer resources (larger size of data and slower access).
How can you solve these problems with a database? You can split information into smaller chunks by creating an additional table Persons with only two columns Name and surname and Address
Persons table
Each row in the table Persons corresponds to a single person. Table Contacts is from now on a relation to the table Persons.

Now enter the text and values shown in the first 5 rows of the above screenshot into the same cells of your spreadsheet. Ignore what is in row 7 for the moment. To enter anything into a cell first select the cell by left clicking inside it then type whatever you want then press Enter; or use the arrow keys to move the selection point to another cell.
What we have entered so far could be a simple budget for the next two months listing how much we think we will be spending for Food Shelter Clothing and any Other expenditure. Now select cell B7 (column B row 7) type in =B2+B3+B4+B5 and press Enter;. Because it begins with a = symbol sheets; sees this as a formula something it has to calculate in this case by adding together the values in the 4 cells B2 to B5 and what is shown in the cell B7 is the result of that calculation.
The Sheet provides more options. The Print settings section lets you select whether or not to print the grid comment indicators and formula indicators objects and charts. The Repetitions on each page section allows you to repeat selected column(s) or row(s) on each printed page. In the section Scaling you can set a scalefactor or the page limits for the print.

Profile Management
This is the small drop down box with the two buttons next to it. You can create new profiles and delete already existing ones. Each profile is saved and specified for the currently connected tablet. If you create a new profile it automatically creates one with the default settings as returned by the wacom-tools.
Here you can specify different profiles for your settings. For example if you like to have a different behavior of the pen when you use it as a mouse replacement for your day to day work or using it as pen to draw something.
Each profile can be changed on the fly and directly changes the behavior of your tablet input.
The kded tablet daemon must be running in the background to be able to change the profiles and apply them to the tablet. All the work is done by the daemon. The systemsettings; module just change the profile settings for it.

The Cosmic Distance Ladder
Altitude vs. Time Tool
B - V = -2.5 log (Fb/Fv) = -2.5 log (1.22) = -0.22
Similarly the color index for red Betelgeuse is
B - V = -2.5 log (Fb/Fv) = -2.5 log (0.18) = 1.85
The color indices like the magnitude scale run backward. Hot and blue stars have smaller and negative values of B-V than the cooler and redder stars.
An Astronomer can then use the color indices for a star after correcting for reddening and interstellar extinction to obtain an accurate temperature of that star. The relationship between B-V and temperature is illustrated in Figure 2.

In the Solar System page you can specify whether the Sun Moon planets comets and asteroids are displayed and whether the major bodies are drawn as colored circles or actual images. You can also toggle whether solar system bodies have name labels attached and control how many of the comets and asteroids get name labels. There is an option to automatically attach a temporary orbit trail whenever a solar system body is tracked and another to toggle whether the color of the orbit trail fades into the background sky color.

The Celestial Sphere
I want kstars; to start up with a time and date different from my system CPU clock. Is this possible?
Yes; to start kstars; with a different time/date use the --date argument followed by a date string like 4 July 1976 123000
I want kstars; to start up with the simulation clock paused. Is this possible?
Yes; to start kstars; with the clock paused simply add the --paused argument to the command line.
How accurate/precise is kstars;?
You do not need to set the geographic location and time every time you connect to a telescope. Only adjust the settings as needed.
You are now ready to use the device features kstars; conveniently provides two interchangeable GUI interfaces for controlling telescopes
Controlling your telescope
Sky map Control For each device you run in the Device Manager a corresponding entry will show up in popup menu that allows you to control the properties of the device. You can issue commands like Slew Sync and Track directly from the sky map.
Here is a screenshot of the popup menu with an active LX200 Classic device
When I try to Connect kstars; reports that the telescope is not connected to the serial/USB port. What can I do?
This message is triggered when kstars; cannot communicate with the telescope. Here are few things you can do
Check that you have both reading and writing permission for the port you are trying to connect to.
Check the connection cable make sure it is in good condition and test it with other applications.
Check your telescope power make sure the power is on and that the telescope is getting enough power.
You can see the pop-up window that comes after right-clicking on an object.
Add objects to Session Plan window
Here is the second way of adding objects in your Observation Plan using the Observing List Wizard. You just need to press the fourth button on the top-left corner of the Observation Planner window.
Despite looking differently this way is basically the same as the first one. Although that it could be a bit more detailed. Here you can see the same categories of objects.
You can choose where these objects to be on the sky. There are four options available for you All over the sky (which is the default option) by constellation and in a region (rectangular or circular).
Now that we have a completed script we can run it in a couple of ways. From a console prompt you can simply execute the script as long as an instance of kstars; is currently running. Alternatively you can execute the script from within kstars; using the Run Script item in the File menu.
Sidereal Time literally means star time. The time we are used to using in our everyday lives is Solar Time. The fundamental unit of Solar Time is a Day the time it takes the Sun to travel 360 degrees around the sky due to the rotation of the Earth. Smaller units of Solar Time are just divisions of a Day
1/24 Day = 1 Hour
1/60 Hour = 1 Minute
1/60 Minute = 1 Second
Set the geographic location to Greenwich England using the Set Location window (Ctrl;G). Note that the Local Time (LT)and the Universal Time (UT) are now the same.
Further Reading The history behind the construction of the first clock that was accurate and stable enough to be used on ships to keep Universal Time is a fascinating tale and one told expertly in the book Longitude by Dava Sobel.
What's Up Tonight? Tool
The What's Up Tonight Tool
The What's Up Tonight? (WUT) tool displays a list of objects that will be visible at night from any location on any date. By default the Date and Location are taken from the current settings in the main window but you can change either value using the Change Date and Change Location buttons at the top of the WUT window.
The king is not in check.
The king does not cross over a square that is attacked by the opponent's pieces.
The king does not end the move on a square that is attacked by the opponent's pieces. (The castling move cannot end with the king in check.)
There are two forms of castling. One is called kingside castling. It is also known as short castling since it is performed to the short side of the board and the rook only has to move two squares to the opposite side of the king. It is diagramed below
The second form of castling is called queenside castling where the king moves towards the square vacated by the queen. It is also known as long castling since it is performed to the long side of the board and the rook has to move three squares to the opposite side of the king. It is diagramed below
Confusions and confusing terminology
Before talking more about working spaces some confusions and confusing terminology needs to be cleared up
First sRGB is both a working color space and an output color space for images intended for the web and for monitor display (if you have a spiffy new monitor with a gamut larger than the gamut covered by sRGB obviously you might want to reconsider what output profile to use to best take advantage of your wonderful and hopefully calibrated and profiled monitor but please convert your image to sRGB before sending it on to your friends!). sRGB is also the color space that a lot of home and mass-production commercial printers expect image files to be in when sent to the printer. It is also the color space that most programs assume if an image does not have an embedded color profile telling the program what color space should be used to interpret (translate) the RGB numbers. So if you choose to not use color-management your color-management choices are simple - set everything to sRGB.
Second all jpegs (or tiffs if you have an older Minolta Dimage camera) coming straight out of a camera (even if produced by point-and-shoots cameras that don't allow you to save a raw file) start life inside the camera as a raw file produced by the camera's A to D converter. The processor inside the camera interpolates the raw file assigns a camera profile translates the resulting RGB numbers to a working space (usually sRGB but sometimes you can choose AdobeRGB depending on the camera) does the jpeg compression and stores the jpeg file on your camera card. So jpegs (or tiffs) from your camera NEVER need to be assigned a camera or input profile which is then translated to a working space via a PCS. Jpegs from a camera are already in a working space.
Third in case anyone is unsure on this point note that an interpolated raw file is no longer a raw file - it has been interpolated and then output as a tiff whose RGB values need to be translated to a working space using the camera profile the PCS and lcms. Fourth (strictly for future reference) to introduce a bit of commonly heard color-management terminology here - the camera profile and your printer's color profile are both device dependent whereas the working space will be device-independent - it can be used with any image with any properly color-managed software without regard for where the image originated.
Camera scanner working space monitor printer - what do all these color profiles really do?
A color profile describes the color gamut of the device or space to which it belongs by specifying what real color in the real world corresponds to each trio of RGB values in the color space of the device (camera monitor printer) or working space.
The camera profile essentially says "for every RGB trio of values associated with every pixel in the image file produced from the raw file by the raw processing software "this RGB image file trio" corresponds to "that real color as seen by a real observer in the real world" (or rather as displayed on the IT8 target if you produced your own camera profile but it amounts to the same thing - the goal of profiling your camera is to make the picture of the target look like the target).
You cannot see an image by looking at its RGB values. Rather you see an image by displaying it on a monitor or by printing it. When you profile your monitor you produce a monitor profile that says "this RGB trio of values that the graphics card sends to the screen" will produce on the screen "that real color as seen by a real observer in the real world".
What the monitor profile and the camera profile have in common is the part (in italics above) about "that real color as seen by a real observer in the real world." Different trios of RGB numbers in respectively the monitor and camera color spaces point to the same real visible color in the real world. Real colors in the real world provide the reference point for translating between all the color profiles your image will ever encounter on its way from camera to screen to editing program to print or the web.
Unfortunately and despite their undeniable mathematical advantages linear gamma working spaces have so few tones in the shadows that (in my opinion) they are impossible to use for editing if one is working in 8-bits and still problematic at 16-bits. When the day comes when we are all doing our editing on 32-bit files produced by our HDR cameras on our personal supercomputers I predict that we will all be using working spaces with gamma=1. Adobe Lightroom is already using a linear gamma working space "under the hood" CS2 allows the option of using linear gamma for mixing colors and Lightzone has always used a linear gamma working space.
How many discrete tonal steps are there in a digital image?
In an 8-bit image you have 256 tonal steps from solid black to solid white. In a 16-bit image theoretically you have 65536 steps. But remember those 16-bits started out as either 10 bits (=1024 steps) 12 bits (=4096 steps) or 14 bits (=16384 steps) as produced by the camera's A-to-D converter - the extra bits to reach 16-bits start out as just padding. The available tones are not distributed evenly from light to dark. In linear gamma mode (as the camera sensor sees things) there's a whole lot more tones in the highlights than in the shadows. Hence the advice if you shoot raw to "expose to the right but don't blow the highlights". See Ron Bigelow's articles on "why raw" for a full discussion of the distribution of available tones in a raw image.
Should I use a large-gamut or a small-gamut working space?
One major consideration in choosing a working space is that some working spaces are bigger than others meaning they cover more of the visible spectrum (and as a consequence include some imaginary colors - mathematical constructs that don't really exist). These bigger spaces offer the advantage of allowing you to keep all the colors captured by your camera and preserved by the LCMS conversion from your camera profile to the super-wide-gamut profile connection space and out again to your chosen working space.
Situated between the more sophisticated Adjust Curves tool and the simpler Brightness/Contrast/Gamma Image Editor tool is this Adjust Levels tool for improving exposure. Although the dialog for this tool looks very complicated for the basic usage we have in mind here the only part you need to deal with is the Input Levels area concretely the 3 sliders that appear below the histogram.
This widget contains a visual graph of the intensity values of the active layer or selection (histogram). Below the graph are five sliders that can be clicked into and dragged to constrain and change the intensity level for the image. The left sliders position represents the dark areas and similarly the right position represents the light areas.
Using the Adjust Levels tool
The Adjust Levels Tool Dialog
Actually the easiest way to learn how to use it is to experiment by moving the three sliders around and watching how the image is affected.
This is a handy tool as it lets you add formatted text easily to an image wherever you want at several places when needed.
Using the Insert Text tool
This tool seems very intuitive to use. Type in your text and place it with the mouse. Use the block settings as you please. Choose the orientation color from a color space and fonts with all their properties. You will have to scale the font size to the image size the larger the image the larger the font has to be! Finally choose to add a border around the text and/or a semitransparent background. Voilà it's finished!
Any text setting you have chosen can always be changed as long as you don't click the OK button. In saved and reloaded images the text has become part of the image it cannot be changed anymore.
The Insert Text tool in action
Save As and Load buttons are used to do just that. Any Photograph Inpainting filter settings that you have set can be saved to the filesystem in a text file and loaded later.
Photograph Inpainting is (comparatively) very fast in what it is doing but it can take a long time to run and cause high CPU load. You may always abort computation by pressing Cancel button during rendering.
The Inpainting tool in action
Below you can see a Remove Small Area Inpainting type applied to a color photograph taken at Guatemala city with an analog camera. Look like there is a strange black artifacts on the face front resulting of a bad film stockage during the travel. The original image is (1) the corrected image (2).
The Inpainting Filter Preview
To set correctly the deconvolution filter the plug-in has the following parameters
Circular Sharpness This is the radius of the Circular convolution filter. It is the most important parameter for using the plug-in. With most images the default value of 1 should give good results. Select a higher value when your image is very blurred but beware of producing halos.
Correlation Increasing the Correlation may help reducing artifacts. The correlation can range from 0-1. Useful values are 0.5 and values close to 1 eg; 0.95 and 0.99. Using a high value for the correlation will reduce the sharpening effect of the plug-in.
Noise filter Increasing the Noise filter parameter helps reducing artifacts. The Noise can range from 0-1 but values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. When the Noise value is too low eg; 0 the image quality will be horrible. A useful value is 0.03. Using a high value for the Noise will even blur the image further.
Gaussian Sharpness This is the radius for the Gaussian convolution filter. Use this parameter when your blurring is Gaussian (mostly due to previous blur filtering). In most cases you should leave this parameter to 0 because it causes nasty artifacts. When you use non-zero values you will probably have to increase the Correlation and/or Noise filter parameters too.

Continue with standard workflow
From there everything is simple select a RAW image and open it in the editor. The color management widget will be displayed after the image has been processed in order to adjust color rendering. Without color management all images are very dark this is normal. You can experiment the various profiles you have in order to select the best input profile according to your image (some tends to be very neutral even a bit dull some gives more saturated results etc;).
This image resizing tool uses a standard linear interpolation method to approximate pixels. If you want to up-size a small image with a better quality try the Blowup tool.
Increasing image size (Restoration)
Many image editing programs use some kind of interpolation eg; spline interpolation to scale-up an image. digikam; uses a more sophisticated approach. The algorithm underlying Restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of GREC CNRS lab in Caen/France and is a part of the CImg project.
Blowup Photograph Dialog
You have to tell the tool about the resizing you want to do. These settings are available in New Size tab and are listed below
For details see the chapter Configure digiKam into Section "Camera".
The digikam; Database
Everyone knows about database it is used to store data. As all other photographs management programs digikam; too uses the database for some obvious reasons like avoiding data duplication reducing data redundancy a quick search engine and greater data integrity. Moreover the cost of data entry storage and retrieval are drastically reduced. Additionally any user can access the data using query language.
Talking in particular about digikam; the Albums Album Roots Tags Thumbnails Face Recognition Data Image Metadata File Paths Settings etc; are all stored in different database files.
The digikam; actually manages more than one databases. For convenience it is broadly categorized in three

The PNG format in the Image file format drop-down menu is not well adapted to reduce photographic images file size but is best suited for compressing lossless items like the TIFF file format. PNG must be used if you use dialup speed Internet and you want to preserve the photo quality. Otherwise JPEG is the recommended format.
If you choose JPEG as the Image file format and the original files were in JPEG format the original Exif data included is preserved in e-mailed images.

What kind of files go together? Segregation of file type makes batch processing easier. Keep new and old files separate.
How can you make that structure scalable?
Segregation of original and working files makes it easier to allocate the backup strategy and migration. You will always know if you look for an original or a derivative.
Automatic metadata generation
How to go about all this metadata business? Firstly there are already a lot of automatically generated metadata EXIF data and Makernotes. If you have configured digikam; with your identity section all imported images will be imprinted with this data set which includes copyrights all automatic. If you have a GPS track recorded in parallel to your taking the photographs you can geolocate those images in a single action using the Geolocation tool. Even if you brought back 1000 images from a shooting session so far you'll not have spent more than 10 minutes to do all that. And by now you have all camera settings of every shot lens data like zoom focus aperture etc; date and time shooting location copyrights authorship program used and more. Not bad isn't it? But we could have done more during the importing we could have changed the file names to include the date or place or theme we could have changed the format to a lossless 16 bit per channel format we could have automatically separated JPEG and RAW files into their folders. I actually recommend to auto-rename to match an event a place or a theme. digikam; provides all date/calendar related grouping so that there's hardly a need for coding the date into the file name. Unless you'd like to do just that to browse your albums with another application that is not calendar savvy. You will buy a new camera one day or you have a second one already sooner than you believe. The numbering scheme of that new camera will start over at typically IMG0001.JPG again creating identical file names to the ones you have already if you do not rename them. By renaming you lessen the chance of inadvertently overwriting them at a later date. Keep the new names clean use alphanumerics dashes underscores and a single period prior to the file extension.
Considering the potential risk to your computing system ensuring its safety from power disturbances is a worthwhile investment. A quality surge suppressor will cost you upward of euro;20 a 500W UPS can be had for less than euro;40. It’s a small cost to pay for the peace of mind you’ll gain knowing your computer is well protected. In the very least pull all lines to your computer when you go on holidays.
Solid state drives USB sticks memory cards flash disks
SSDs are mechanically more robust than HDDs and suffer much less on that front when they are plugged into the computer. But since they are mostly mobile devices their exposure to drops accidents and electrostatic discharges is much higher. So for different reasons SDDs are as likely to fail if not more than hard drives. Add the danger of theft and longevity and limited capacity and SDDs will become prohibitive as permanent data storage devices.
One major cause for data loss (often recoverable) is the unsafe removal of SDDs from a computer. Before data is saved from a computer memory to any attached device it remains for some time in buffers. In hard drives this means seconds at most whereas with SDDs it can be tens of minutes. Therefore before you disconnect a flash device always activate data flushing through software (often called "safely remove device").
There is a new technology trend coming up to replace hard drives with SSD flash drives. By 2010 they may be competitive in price to HDDs. Data retention is an issue with SDDs it cannot be overwritten an infinite amount of times. SDDs wear in use. Wear then depends much on the location data is written and how often it is written. Linux; has developed a special driver avoiding writing to the same spot too often. But this is all premature information. Keep your eyes and ears open.
Many photographers prefer keeping an original of their shots (mostly RAW) for the archive. XMP suits that approach as it keeps metadata separate from the image file. I do not share this point of view. There could be problems linking metadata file and image file and as said above RAW formats will become obsolete. I recommend using DNG as a container and putting everything inside.
The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization engaged in the development of interoperable online metadata standards that support a broad range of purposes and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling discussions and collaborative work in DCMI Communities and DCMI Task Groups annual conferences and workshops standards liaison and educational efforts to promote widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices.
Best practice Data protection
Use surge protectors (UL 1449 standard) possibly combined with a UPS
use ECC memory to verify correct data transmission (even just saving files)
Viewing an image
There are several possibilities to view an image. You can either click on it select  F3 ViewPreview Image  from the menu bar or select Preview Image from the context menu. The Preview Area will open and the Icon Area will be reduced to one line. For viewing it larger click the sidebars away (by just clicking on the active button on them). An even larger view you can achieve by clicking the Show Fullscreen icon     either on the thumbnail or on the preview. While viewing images you can take action from the context menu at any time (not in fullscreen mode). To close the preview just click again or press Esc; or F3 or click the Table or Thumbnails button.
You can also view your images in a slideshow using the Slideshow drop down menu from the Main Toolbar. You have the choice to start a slideshow with a selection of photographs the whole content of the folder (or search result) or even including all subfolders.
Editing a Photograph
You can open the Image Editor on a photograph either clicking the Image Editor button on the Main Toolbar or by selecting  F4 ItemOpen  from the menu bar or clicking with the RMB; and selecting Open from the context menu. See the digikam; Image Editor section for instructions on how to edit your photographs. The Image Editor offers a wide range of tools to enhance decorate and/or modify your photographs.
If you want to delete or rename a saved search from the list click with the RMB; on it and select from the context menu.
The Advanced Search Tool
Advanced Search tool provides an extended search form which can be used to search in specific fields of the digikam; database in a more sophisticated way. Click the Advanced Search button and it will come up like this
The field labeled Find pictures that have associated all these words is just a duplicate of the Quick Search field.
Click on one of the blue categories and there will fold out an area with all the fields you can search for in that very category. Depending on the kind of data each field contains different input fields for your search sometimes more than one type for the same field. Simplest are selection buttons eg; for colors. Then you have plain fields of the The field content contains type drop down lists and checkboxes. Many fields have two input fields allowing you to define a range eg; Find pictures with a width between. And often you find a link type thing called Any which opens a drop down field with checkboxes for the possible contents of that field.
The MySQL Database
MySQL Versus SQLite
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system written in C and C++. Original development of MySQL by Michael Widenius and David Axmark beginning in 1994. Sun Microsystems acquired MySQL in 2008 which was later acquired by Oracle in 2010. MySQL currently works on almost all system platforms (Linux Microsoft Windows OS X SunOS ).
MariaDB server is a community developed fork of MySQL server. Started by core members of the original MySQL team MariaDB actively works with outside developers to deliver the most featureful stable and sanely licensed open SQL server in the industry.
MariaDB has actually overtaken MySQL ‘cause of few basic reasons
With the Sidebar tab title setting you can set how sidebars on the sides will show the tab titles. Use Only For Active Tab option only if you use a small screen resolution as with a laptop computer. Else For All Tabs will be a best choice to discover quickly all internal features of digikam;.
With the Widget style setting you can choose the default application window decoration and looks. Fusion style is the best choice under all desktop.
With the Icon theme setting you can choose the default application icon theme. Theme availability depends of desktop used to run digikam;.
With the String comparison type setting you can set the way in which strings are compared inside digikam;. This influences the sorting of the tree views. Natural tries to compare strings in a way that regards some normal conventions. The result will be sort naturally even if they have a different number of digits inside. Normal uses a more technical approach. Use this style if you want to entitle albums with ISO dates (201006 or 20090523) and the albums should be sorted according to these dates.
With the Confirm when moving items to trash and Confirm when permanently deleting items settings you can set the verbosity of digikam; when you delete a photograph or an Album. See Deleting a Photograph and Deleting an Album sections for more details.

This sidebar tab serves to apply and edit image attributes like captions rating date and tags. The attributes are stored in the associated database in the IPTC and EXIF data fields and become part of the image. All attributes are accessible in one sidebar view as shown in the screenshot below. During image reading the order of priority is a) database b) IPTC and c) EXIF. So if there is a discrepancy between any of the three this priority will take effect and a synchronization will take place. This sidebar has a first-previous-next-last arrow navigator field on top if shown in the main application.

Next you specify whether a kphotoalbum; export file should be generated and put on the overview page. See  for details on export files. And if you want to have movies included in-line or as downloadable objects.
Finally you may specify which information should be generated on the HTML; pages. This way you may skip generating information which might be obvious to the reader of the pages (say these images was from the party we all attended). Notice kphotoalbum; does currently not allow you to exclude certain categories from the export file so don't rely on this as a way of excluding information you do not want readers of your pages to see.
The Layout page
On the layout page you specify what your HTML; pages should look like. Most of the options on this page are straight forward and do not need further description here. A short intro to each theme is shown when you select the theme to give some idea what it should look like.

Annotating one item at a time
When you specify properties for one image at a time you may still of course select a number of images and say I want to annotate these images. In this situation you will find a next and previous button under the image in the topmost rightmost corner.
Annotating multiple items at a time
If you have several images with say the same person then it might be more convenient to select those images and specify that this person is on all images using the Annotate Multiple Items at a Time.
If you want to annotate a stack of images you can do that when the stack is collapsed. You just need to select the top image of the stack and annotate multiple images. (If you annotate single image only the selected image the stack head in this case is being annotated.) Of course expanding the stack and selecting all images works as well.
You can still add tagging at this point to the panorama or you might include all the source images also with Ctrl;2.

Setting up a session and importing an existing project
Let's stick with the Linux; kernel and device driver example mdash; you may want to substitute your own set of libraries or projects for these two examples. To create a new session that contains these two projects go to the SessionStart new session menu at the top left (or if this is the first time you use kdevelop; simply use the default session you get on first use which is empty).
We next want to populate this session with projects that for the moment we assume already exist somewhere (the case of starting projects from scratch is discussed elsewhere in this manual). For this there are essentially two methods depending on whether the project already is somewhere on your hard drive or whether it needs to be downloaded from a server.
Option 1 Importing a project from a version control system server
Let's first assume that the project we want to set up mdash; the Linux; kernel mdash; resides in some version control system on a server but that you haven't checked it out to your local hard drive yet. In this case go to the Project menu to create the Linux; kernel as a project inside the current session and then follow these steps
To see the list of all uses of a name through which these commands cycle place the cursor onto it and open the Code Browser tool view or press and hold the Alt; button. This is explained in more detail in the section on Exploring code.
The context list Web browsers have this feature where you can go backward and forward in the list of most recently visited web pages. kdevelop; has the same kind of features except that instead of web pages you visit contexts. A context is the current location of the cursor and you change it by navigating away from it using anything but cursor commands mdash; for example by clicking on a location provided by a tooltip in the Code Browser tool view one of the options given in the Navigation menu or any other navigation command. Using the NavigationPrevious Visited Context (MetaLeft) and NavigationNext Visited Context (MetaRight) transports you along this list of visited contexts just like the back and forward buttons of a browser transports you to the previous or next webpage in the list of visited pages.
Finally there are tool views that allow you to navigate to different places in your code base. For example the Classes tool provides you with a list of all namespaces and classes in all projects of the current session and allows you to expand it to see member functions and variables of each of these classes               Double-clicking on an item (or going through the context menu using the right mouse button) allows you to jump to the location of the declaration of the item. Other tools allow similar things; for example the Projects tool view provides a list of files that are part of a session               Again double-clicking on a file opens it.
Writing source code
Because kdevelop; understands your projects' source code it can assist in writing more code. The following outlines some of the ways in which it does that.
Other files
While classes and unit tests receive special attention when generating code from templates the same method can be used for any kind of source code files. For example one could use a template for a CMake Find module or a .desktop file. This can be done by choosing Create from Template and selecting the wanted category and template. If the selected category is neither Class nor Test you will only have the option of choosing the license any custom options specified by the template and the output file locations. As with classes and tests finishing the assistant will generate the files and open them in the editor.
Managing templates
From the FileNew from Template assistant you can also download additional file templates by clicking the Get more Templates button. This opens a Get Hot New Stuff dialog where you can install additional templates as well as update or remove them. There is also a configuration module for templates which can be reached by clicking SettingsConfigure kdevelop;Templates. From there you can manage both file templates (explained above) and project templates (used for creating new projects).
Of course if none of the available template suit your project you can always create new ones. The easiest way is probably to copy and modify an existing template while a short tutorial and a longer specification document are there to help you. To copy an installed template open the template manager by clicking SettingsConfigure KDevelopTemplates select the template you wish to copy then click the Extract Template button. Select a destination folder then click OK and the contents of the template will be extracted into the selected folder. Now you can edit the template by opening the extracted files and modifying them. After you are done you can import your new template into kdevelop; by opening the template manager activating the appropriate tab (either Project Templates or File Templates) and clicking Load Template. Open the template description file which is the one with the suffix either .kdevtemplate or .desktop. kdevelop; will compress the files into a template archive and import the template.

Also as satellite systems use a wide bandwidth and accept signals using different polarities it is common to use a protocol - called DiSEqC - in order to select a range of channels to be received.
The first step is to teach kaffeine; about the satellite configuration via the Configuration combo box
Satellite device definitions
The following values are possible
DiSEqC Switch - The antenna cable is connected to a DiSEqC switch or the LNBf requires DiSEqC commands to select a range of channels. This is the most common setting. It allows having up to 4 satellites connected at the same time each with its own dish. For each satellite you need to set the configuration for the LNBf at the dish pointing to it.

Screenshot of the preview dialog
The preview dialog
The preview dialog acts like a simple file manager. You can navigate through the contents of the remote share by clicking the folder icons in the list view and the Up Back and Forward button. The current location is displayed in the combo box on the right hand side. The Reload button reloads the contents of the current folder.
By default the preview dialog only shows folders and files that are not hidden. You can change this behavior in the configuration dialog. File transfers or the like are not possible.
Providing Authentication Information
Screenshot of the synchronization progress dialog
Progress dialog
In the default collapsed version it displays the source and destination of the file that is currently transferred the transfer rate and the overall progress. More information like the number of transferred files and a graphical representation of the transfer rate can be seen by clicking the [+] (More) button on the left below to the progress bar.
The synchronization can be paused or canceled at any time by pressing the pause or stop button to the right of the progress bar.
The total number of files that is shown in the progress dialog corresponds to the number of files present on the share and not necessarily to the total number of files that will actually be transferred.
Popup menu of the bookmark editor
Add a bookmark group. After you created a group you can move bookmarks to it.
Remove a selected bookmark or group. In case of a group all bookmarks stored under that group are also removed.
Remove all bookmarks from the tree view including all groups.
After you finished editing the changes can be committed by clicking the OK button.
You will not only see the shares that were mounted and are owned by you but also all other mounts using the SMBFS (FreeBSD) and CIFS (Linux;) file system that are present on the system.
Here you can change the settings affecting the authentication.
Screenshot of the "Authentication" configuration page
The "Authentication" configuration page
The login names and passwords are stored in a subfolder named Smb4K of the current network wallet (default "kdewallet"). The advantage of this method is that the authentication data is stored permanently and encrypted on your hard drive. You only have to provide it once and the next time it is needed smb4k; will read it from the wallet. If you uncheck this option the authentication data won't be stored at all.
For each share you synchronize a new subdirectory below this prefix will be generated. If you want to synchronize the contents of a share to a different folder you can define it in the synchronization dialog.
Default $HOME/smb4ksync/
Option -a/--archive same as -rlptgoD (no -H)
Switch the archive mode on. This is a quick way of saying you want recursion and want to preserve almost everything. Note that -a does not preserve hardlinks because finding multiply-linked files is expensive. You must separately specify -H.
Option -r/--recursive
This option filters out the .rsync-filter files themselves from the transfer.
Option -S/--sparse
Try to handle sparse files efficiently so they take up less space on the destination. Conflicts with --inplace because it's not possible to overwrite data in a sparse fashion.
Do not use this option when the destination is a Solaris; "tmpfs" file system. It doesn't seem to handle seeks over null regions correctly and ends up corrupting the files.
Option -W/--whole-file
Mention your operating system (Linux; FreeBSD etc;) and the distribution that is running on your computer.
Include the full error message if an error dialog was displayed.
If you experienced a crash attach a full backtrace. For this it is recommended that you (re-)compile smb4k; with debugging symbols. How this is done is mentioned in the Configuration Compilation and Installation chapter in the appendix.
Add additional data eg; send a screen shot if you are reporting a GUI; related problem.
The recommended method to report a bug is to use the dialog that opens when you click the HelpReport Bug menu item. But you can also go directly to the KDE Bugtracking System and fill out the form.
tellico; is not an audio or video player. It does not provide facilities for reading or modifying multimedia files. It also does not provide any image-editing functionality. Although tellico; has some functionality for managing bibliography lists it is not a full-blown bibliographic reference manager. tellico; also does not pretend to have all the capabilities of a full-fledged relational database.
As somewhat of a disclaimer tellico; is a hobby for the author and no guarantees are made about its functionality usefullness or otherwise. More information is included in the license declaration.
In tellico; a collection is the document. Only one collection exists in each tellico; file. A collection contains any number of fields and entries. tellico; supports 12 specific collection types by default books bibliographic entries comic books videos music trading cards coins stamps video games wines board games and file listings. In addition an empty generic collection template is available for any other type of collectibles or lists.
Each collection may have an unlimited number of fields. tellico; supports eleven types of fields which allow for a range of different data. The fields can be edited with the Collection Fields Dialog and are explained further in the Field Types section.
Collection Entries
MusicBrainz.org is a community music metadatabase that attempts to create a comprehensive music information site.
Video Game Data Sources
GiantBomb.com is a large community-driven video game database. Registration for a free account is required.
TheGamesDB.net is an open online database for video game fans.
Data Sources for Multiple Collection Types
Part of the reason I started appname; was to learn C++. I didn't know SQL at the time and at the moment I only have a faint knowledge of how to use it. Simply put appname; didn't start out as a relational database and that won't change until sometime in the future when I get around to learning SQL and have the time and motivation to change the data model. If that bothers you well don't use appname; then.
Of course anyone is welcome to make any changes they want to with the source code.
Using appname;
By default appname; starts with an empty book collection. To work with some other type of collection create it using the FileNew menu item or the button on the toolbar. Collections are populated with some of the more common fields but you can add modify or delete them to suit your needs.
New entries can be added by using the Entry Editor. The CollectionNew Entry menu item will open the Entry Editor with an empty entry ready for editing. The Entry Editor can also be opened by using the SettingsShow Entry Editor menu item. Once you've entered the values for the entry you can save it to the collection by using the Save Entry button in the Entry Editor dialog which remains open in case you want to continue adding new entries. Once you've saved an entry in the collection you can modify it by clicking on it in the main window. If the Entry Editor is not already open you can double click an entry to open the editor and start editing.
If a book has more than one author you should separate their names by a semi-colon so that Tellico will know to split them and use them separately. Any other field which allows multiple values should be entered the same way. with a semi-colon (;) separating each value.
You can change which fields are shown in the list view by right-clicking on the column header.
You can add edit or modify the fields in the collection using the Collection Fields Dialog. The arrow buttons below the field list can be used to change the position of the field in the list which affects the placement in the entry editor.
If you want to filter by a Checkbox field a value of "true" should be used. If you'd like to filter to show only the science fiction books which you've not read for example check the Match all of the following button set the first rule to have "Genre" "contains" "Science Fiction" (no quotes) and the second rule to have "Read" "does not contain" "true" (no quotes).
If a non-word character is used in the Quick Filter the text is interpreted as a regular expression. To show only books which are by Weber or Bujold for example then type "weber|bujold" (no quotes) in the filter box.
In addition if the disc contains CD;-Text that information is read and added to the imported entry.
Importing Audio File Metadata
appname; is able to scan a folder and read the tags for common audio file formats such as mp3 and ogg. The songs are entered in a music collection where each entry is an album. If the song files contain the track number the song name is inserted in the correct spot in the track list. The artist and genre information is also added to the entry. If the song tags contain comments they are appended to the comments field in the entry preceded by the file name.
In addition if a folder contains a .directory file and the folder name matches an album title the Icon entry in the desktop file is used as the cover image for the album.
The audio file metadata importer can recursively scan a folder to find all audio files in any subfolder though symbolic links are not followed. appname; uses the TagLib library for reading the audio file metadata and so can import data from any file type that TagLib understands.
Collection Merge Entries
This command merges the selected entries.
Collection Update Entry
This menu contains a list of all available data sources and can be used to automatically query the source and update the selected entries.

The conclusion page resumes the information you have sent during the wizard process. It has not done anything yet so you can still give up clicking Cancel button. If you click on Finish it will send all the information and create the account if you chose to create it or register it if you were registering an existing account. As it has not sent the information at this step it cannot know if the registration will succeed. To check this once you are in the main window go to the account settings page to see the state of your accounts.

Open repository or working copy mark item you want to merge and select  Subversion General Merge . Enter in the following dialog the values wanted. If opened from repository source 1 and source 2 are filled when open from within working copy target is filled with current selected item. The handling of this parameter is a little bit different between using the internal diff of subversion or an external merge-program like kdiff3;. The target must ALWAYS a local folder or file. You may switch between external or internal merge with the check box Use external merge.
Internal merge
The meaning is exactly like from within subversion's own command line tool. When source1 and source2 are equal start and endrevision must different. If sources aren't equal start-revision is assigned to source1 and end-revision to source2. The target MUST be a working copy otherwise subversion will send an error message.
The check boxes have following meanings
Do all operations recursive when working with folders.
urls is a list of local urls to commit. Will ask for log message.
int startrevnumber QString startrevstring int endrevnumber QString endrevstring KURLList

kdesvn exec log -l 20 -r HEAD#058;1 myfile.c
Beware of order of revision You want go from HEAD to START for the LAST one. So you must give revision HEAD as starting point otherwise you would get the first 20 entries.
The diff command
You get differences between revisions of an item or between two items inside same working copy or repository. When diff'ing revisions of an item revisions may be given as -r STARTREVENDREV. When diffing an item inside a working copy without any revisions it prints the diff against repository.

Note that the policies that you set using this control module will not apply to other web browsers such as firefox;.
Using the Policy tab you can configure the kde; applications that will handle cookies. You can do this by specifying a general cookie policy as well as special cookie policies for certain domains or hosts.
The top of the policy tab has a check box labeled Enable cookies. If you leave this unchecked cookies will be completely disabled. However this may make browsing rather inconvenient especially as some web sites require the use of browsers with cookies enabled.
You will probably want to enable cookies and then set specific policies on how you want them to be handled.
The first group of options create settings that apply to all cookies.
However you may find that some web sites refuse to function correctly unless you are using a browser recognized as proper by that site. In these cases you may find it necessary to fool the web site by having konqueror; report itself to be another browser by means of the user agent header.
In this module you can configure the type of browser that konqueror; will report itself to be. You can control this information by web site. Usually the list box that is labeled Site Specific Identification will be empty so that konqueror; will always use its default useragent string.
You can disable the sending of a user agent entirely by unchecking the Send identification check box. This may cause strange behavior on some sites and may even deny you access to some websites so disable this with caution.
To configure a new agent binding press the New button. Type the name of the server or a domain in the text box at the top of the dialog that pops up which is labeled When browsing the following site.
Note that you can not use the wildcard character * in this text box. However the string kde.org will match all hosts in the domain kde.org

As well as the text roles there are a few additional quot;decorationquot; roles that are used for drawing lines or shading UI elements (while the above may in appropriate circumstances also be used for this purpose the following are specifically not meant for drawing text). These are
Focus Decoration mdash; used to indicate the item which has active input focus.
Hover Decoration mdash; used for mouse-over effects eg; the "illumination" effects for buttons.
In addition except for Inactive Text there is a corresponding background role for each of the text roles. Currently (except for Normal and Alternate Background) these colors are not chosen by the user but are automatically determined based on Normal Background and the corresponding Text color. These colors may be previewed by selecting one of the sets other than quot;Common Colorsquot;.
The choice of color role is left to the developer; the above are guidelines intended to represent typical usage.
Font Filtering
A text field on top of the font preview allows you to filter the list of fonts. You can filter fonts based upon different categories

If this option is selected action buttons (like OK and Apply) will have a small icon located within them to act as a visual reference. If this option is not selected then only text will appear in the button.
If this option is selected kde; applications will show small icons alongside most menu items. If this option is not selected then only text will appear in the menus. Changes to the visibility of menu icons will only affect newly started applications.
Adding Groups
The module allows to you to sort related shortcuts into Groups. For instance if you have some shortcuts that relate to your music player you could create a group for them called Music Player.
To add a new group click on the Edit button below the left pane and select the New Group option.
Adding Shortcuts
To add a new shortcut click on the Edit button below the left pane and select the New option.
Three window characteristics are available
Window title - The title that appears at the top of the window.
Window class - Usually the name of the application.
Window role - Usually the name of the Qt; class that makes up the window.
Each window characteristic provides a drop-down box and a text box below it. Enter the value you wish to test windows for in the text box. From the drop-down box select which kind of test you wish to apply. You can use Is to require an exact match Contains to require that the text entered be somewhere inside the full value or Matches Regular Expression to use a regular expression to define the match. You may also perform the inverse of all these operations. Select Is Not Important if you do not wish for that particular characteristic to be examined.
This is the maximum amount of time between clicks to register a double click. If you click twice and the time between those two clicks is less than this number that is recognized as a double click. If the time between these two clicks is greater than this number it is recognized as two separate single clicks.
Drag start time and Drag start distance
If you  click with the mouse drag within the time specified in Drag start time and  move a distance equal to or greater than the number (of pixels) specified in Drag start distance   the selected item will be dragged.
If you have a wheel mouse use the spin box to determine how many lines of text one step of the mouse wheel will scroll.
This tab allows you to configure the keyboard number pad keys as a mouse-type device. This may be useful when you are working on a device without another pointing device or where you have no other use for the number pad.
You can manually choose a profile using this keyword. All available profiles will be shown in form of krunner; matches.
screen brightness or dim screen
You can control screen brightness through this keyword. In this form some krunner; matches that let you do some common actions will be shown. If you enter a value after the keyword (eg; Screen Brightness 50) the brightness will be set to that value.
suspend sleep hibernate to ram or to disk
You can set your computer into a low power mode through these keywords. Available methods will be shown as krunner; matches.
Focus does not necessarily mean the window is the one at the front mdash; this is referred to as raised and although this is configured here as well focus and raising of windows are configured independently.
There are six methods kde; can use to determine the current focus
A window becomes active when you click into it. This behaviour is common on other operating systems and likely what you want.
Click To Focus - Mouse Precedence
This is mostly the same as Click To Focus. If an active window has to be chosen by the system (eg; because the currently active one was closed) the window under the mouse is the preferred candidate. Unusual but possible variant of Click To Focus.
You can tailor children windows for the application by placing the more restrictive rules first - see the Kopete and Kopete Chat Window example.
Rule Editor
The editor is composed of four tabs
Size amp; Position
Arrangement amp; Access
The Edit Window-Specific Settings window is displayed. Window matching is the default tab
Click Detect Window Properties with 0s delay the cursor immediately turns into cross-hairs. Click (anywhere) inside the akregator; window (but not the title bar). The window criteria are presented. Match only by primary class name so leave the check boxes unchecked - for additional information see window matching
Clicking OK the previous window back-fills the results in the Window Matching tab. Enter a meaningful text in the Description field (which is displayed in the KWin Rule window)
Enable the window attributes Position Size and Desktop. The initial values are set by Detect Window Properties and can be overridden
Clicking OK in the previous window returns to the main KWin Rules. The new rule with its description is listed
kdesu; uses the sytem's su for acquiring priviliges. In this section I explain the details of how kdesu; does this.
Because some su implementations (ie; the one from RedHat;) don't want to read the password from stdin kdesu; creates a pty/tty pair and executes su with its standard filedescriptors connected to the tty.
To execute the command the user selected rather than an interactive shell kdesu; uses the -c argument with su. This argument is understood by every shell that I know of so it should work portably. su passes this -c argument to the target user's shell and the shell executes the program. Example command su root -c theprogram.
Instead of executing the user command directly with su kdesu; executes a little stub program called kdesustub. This stub (running as the target user) requests some information from kdesu; over the pty/tty channel (the stub's stdin and stdout) and then executes the user's program. The information passed over is the X display an X authentication cookie (if available) the PATH and the command to run. The reason why a stub program is used is that the X cookie is private information and therefore cannot be passed on the command line.
Password Checking
The top section shows you the total physical memory total free physical memory shared memory and buffered memory.
All four values are represented as the total number of bytes and as the number of megabytes (1 megabyte = slightly more than 1000000 bytes)
The bottom section shows you three graphs
Total Memory (this is the combination of physical and virtual memory).
Virtual memory or Swap Space.
Here you see which Samba- and NFS-shares from other hosts are mounted on your local system. The first column shows whether it is a Samba- or NFS-share the second column displays the name of the share and the third shows where it is mounted.
The mounted NFS-shares you should see on Linux; (this has been tested) and it should also work on Solaris; (this has not been tested).
This page presents the contents of your local samba log file in a nice way. If you open this page the list will be empty. You have to press the Update button then the samba log file will be read and the results displayed. Check whether the samba log file on your system is really at the location as specified in the input line. If it is somewhere else or if it has another name correct it. After changing the file name you have to press Update again.
Samba logs its actions according to the log level (see smb.conf). If loglevel = 1 samba logs only when somebody connects to your machine and when this connection is closed again. If log level = 2 it logs also if somebody opens a file and if he closes the file again. If the log level is higher than 2 yet more stuff is logged.
If you are interested in who accesses your machine and which files are accessed you should set the log level to 2 and regularly create a new samba log file (eg; set up a cron task which once a week moves your current samba log file into another folder or something like that). Otherwise your samba log file may become very big.
If selected in addition to the actions you defined a list of applications for the detected MIME type will appear in the popup menu.
Editing Expressions/Actions
On the Actions page double-click the regular expression or action that you want to edit or select it and press the Edit Action button. A dialog will appear in which the expression text can be edited as you wish.
Adding Expressions/Actions
Click the Add Action button to add a regular expression for klipper; to match. klipper; uses Qt;'s QRegExp which understands most regular expressions as you would use in grep or egrep for instance.

Remove an entry from the menu view in the application launcher.
Specify the work path of the program. This will be the current path when the program launches. It does not need to be the same as the executable location.
You must check this if your program requires terminal emulator in order to run. This mainly applies to console applications.
The ksysguard; main window consists of a menu bar an optional tool bar and status bar and the work space. Custom worksheets will also show the sensor browser.
By default ksysguard; shows two worksheets Process Table and System Load. The Process Table lists the running processes and lets the user control them. Multiple processes can be selected and controlled at once. The System Load worksheet shows graphs of system utilization CPU History Memory and Swap History and the Network History.
This default setup is sufficient enough for an inexperienced user to do some system management. An experienced user or even a system administrator of a large computer lab has different needs. To address a wide range of users ksysguard; is highly flexible.
You can launch the Process Table using the global shortcut  Ctrl;Esc; at any time. The process table is displayed in a window titled System Activities.
The Process Table gives you a list of processes on your system. The list can be sorted by each column. Just press the left mouse button at the head of the column.

The integrated course editor is an advanced tool for language course contributors that allows the creation and collaborative work on language courses for artikulate;. On the one hand it allows the creation of language courses and recording of the native speaker sound files. On the hand it enables work on so called skeletons which are language course prototypes that allow easy and fast creation of new courses derived from a prototype. The editor only edits files outside of the training course set i.e. the set of courses downloaded in artikulate;.

What is stored by khangman; and where
When you get a new language via Game Get Words in New Language the new language data is stored in $XDGDATAHOME/share/apps/kvtml/ in the language code folder. The available language dir names are also stored in the khangman; config file in $XDGDATAHOME/share/config/khangmanrc.
The provider name (i.e. the address of the website where to download the new languages) is stored in $XDGDATADIRS/share/apps/khangman/khangmanrc.
The English language (default) and the user language from his i18n package(s) (if available) are stored in $XDGDATADIRS/share/apps/kvtml.
In kig; you can undo almost any change you make in the document. Just use the Undo/Redo buttons on the toolbar the Edit menu or the appropriate shortcuts.
kig; also has a Full Screen mode. To use it click the appropriate button on the toolbar or select SettingsFull Screen Mode.
To leave Full Screen mode RMB; click the screen at a place where there is no object present and select Exit Full Screen Mode or press the shortcut Ctrl;Shift;F.
kig; Object Types
kig; supports a rather large number of object types. Please note that not all of the available object types are shown in the toolbars there are some objects that you can only construct via the Objects menu in the menu bar. Of course as with all kde; applications the contents of the toolbars are configurable. Try out the SettingsConfigure Toolbars option if you want to do this.
Do not show a GUI;. Instead convert the specified file to native kig; format. The native kig; file will be written to standard output unless --outfile is passed.
-o --outfile filename
Used with --convert-to-native to specify where to save the newly created kig; file. Not specifying this option or providing a filename of - will output the file to standard output.
More detailed user documentation is available from help/kig (either enter this URL into konqueror; or run khelpcenter help/kig).
There is also further information available at the kde; Edutainment website.
sounds
klettres; is a very simple application that helps a child or an adult to learn the alphabet and some simple sounds in his own language or in another language. The program picks up a letter or a syllable in random this letter/syllable is displayed and the sound is played. The user should then type this letter or syllable. Training is done in the levels where the letter/syllable is not displayed only the sound is played. The user does not need to know how to use the mouse the keyboard only is needed.
There are twenty five languages available at the moment see the list above. If your kde; language is among those then it is taken as default otherwise French is the default. You can easily get any additional available language by using the File menu and Get Alphabet in New Language menu item provided that your computer is connected to the Internet.
Two different modes allow you to adapt klettres; to your need and have the full usual interface or a stripped interface. For a child the menubar is no longer visible. We assume that a child will not want to set the language himself. A combo box allows him to choose the different levels. For an older user the background is not so childish and the menubar is present in the Grown-Up style. Three different themes (Kid Desert and Savannah) set up a different background with different fonts and colors.
You do not need the language keyboard layout anymore as you can use the special Special Characters toolbar to type any special character in each language. In the Settings menu Toolbars Shown select Special Characters and the toolbar will appear at the bottom of klettres;. Click on the letter you want and it will be shown in the input field. This toolbar can be dragged anywhere on your screen.

kturtle; is an educational programming environment that aims to make learning how to program as easy as possible. To achieve this kturtle; makes all programming tools available from the user interface. The programming language used is turtlescript; which allows its commands to be translated.
A lot of commands need a number of pixels as input. These commands are forward backward go gox goy canvassize and penwidth.
In early versions of kturtle; the canvas was essentially a raster image yet for recent versions the canvas is a vector drawing. This means that the canvas can be zoomed in and out therefore a pixel does not necessarily have to translate to one dot on the screen.
RGB combinations (color codes)
RGB combinations are used to describe colors. The R stand for red the G stands for green and the B stands for blue. An example of an RGB combination is 25500 the first value (red) is 255 and the others are 0 so this represents a bright shade of red. Each value of an RGB combination has to be in the range 0 to 255. Here a small list of some often used colors
Often used RGB combinations
There are two commands to clean up the canvas after you have made a mess.
clear (ccl)
With clear you can clean all drawings from the canvas. All other things remain the position and angle of the turtle the canvascolor the visibility of the turtle and the canvas size.
reset cleans much more thoroughly than the clear command. After a reset command everything is like is was when you had just started kturtle;. The turtle is positioned at the middle of the screen the canvas color is white the turtle draws a black line on the canvas and the canvassize is set to 400 x 400 pixels.
The turtle is a sprite
File Export to HTML
Exports the current content of the Editor as an HTML file that includes highlighting colors.
Prints the current code in the editor.
Quits kturtle;.
Undoes the last change to code. kturtle; has unlimited undos.
Change the font used to display the vocabulary.
Vocabulary Link Image
Specify the image that should be linked with the current entry.
Vocabulary Link Sound
Specify the sound that should be linked with the current entry.
You can configure the behavior of the Enter; key when working in the editor.
You can also select if the functions for Fill-in-the-blank should be activated. Turning them off will speed up performance a little.
For flashcard sessions you can select if the cards should be flipped automatically and if they should be counted as correct or incorrect. Enter a time delay in seconds for the automatic flipping.
For multiple choice sessions you can select if your choice should be checked immediately or if you have to select QuizCheck first.
For question amp; answer sessions you can select if questions where you use QuizHint should be counted as incorrect.

What is gwenview;
gwenview; is a fast and easy to use image and video viewer.
gwenview; features two main modes Browse and View. Both modes can be used in a normal application window and Full Screen. Browse Mode lets you navigate through your computer showing thumbnails of your images View Mode lets you view images one at a time and Full Screen lets you make quick slideshows. There is also a start screen that displays a list of recently opened folders and URL;s as well as your places and tags.
Image loading is handled by the Qt; library so gwenview; supports all image formats your Qt; installation supports. gwenview; correctly displays images with an alpha channel (transparency) as well as animations.

This reduces the entire image or selection to black and white.
If you do not want the image or selection to be dithered use the  Reduce Colors dialog.
Resizing the image changes the dimensions of the image without applying a transformation to the existing contents. Scaling the image will stretch the existing contents to the new dimensions. Smooth Scale generally provides better quality results than Scaling by blending neighbouring colors.
You can express the new dimensions in pixels or as a percentage of the original size. If you select Keep aspect ratio the width and height will be scaled by the same percentage.
You can free-form Resize the entire image or Smooth Scale the selection using the corresponding handles.

The Submit tab sets up connection to a mail server or a web server to submit new CDDB entries. This is useful if you do not have your own system configured as a server.
If you plan to submit a CDDB entry enter your email address into the first textbox then you must decide between submitting between HTTP; and submitting the entry as an email (via SMTP;).
It is simpler to submit new entries using HTTP;. Some firewalls block this traffic. If your firewall prevents you from sending new entries using HTTP; you can use SMTP;.
First select either HTTP; or SMTP (Email) to determine which protocol to use.

Set the amount of error detection and correction used when extracting data.
No detection or correction. Only useful if you have a perfect CD drive (unlikely).
Enable basic error checking and correction.
Default. Specifies that only a perfect extraction will be accepted.
Note that there is a disadvantage to level 2. Extraction can be very slow so real-time digital playback may not work properly. If you have a good quality CD drive (note that more expensive does not necessarily mean better quality) then you probably won't experience very slow extraction but a poor drive may take days (!) to extract the audio from one CD.

If you are interested what has been done and what has still to be done then look at the files CHANGES and TODO included in the source package. Help and constructive critics are always welcome.
kwave; Resources
So if you want to get in contact with the developers need some further help on using kwave; submit patches bug reports or other stuff the following resources might be of interest for you
The plans for future include support for import and also export filters for more formats and maybe some filter that uses a user-definable script with a call to an external filter so that even formats not supported by SoX can be read and/or written.
Format of ASCII files
The ASCII format is quite useful for scientific and educational purposes. Due to it's simple format you can either write simple files on your own with a text editor or you can use the output of some other application and convert it into ASCII. As the format is really simple you should not have big problems in writing a converter and most scientific applications use to have some kind of their own ASCII format for export.
The format of an ASCII file is quite simple and has the following rules
At the start of the file comes a block of properties with one property per line.
Note If a channel is de-selected it will also not be audible for playback!
Selecting samples
If you select a range of samples in kwave; that range will be inclusive. That means that the first and the last selected sample both belong to the selection and will be used for the following actions. So even if you not selected a range but only a single sample the selection will never be really "empty". So for example if you see no selected range the "delete" function applies to that single sample.
The easiest way of selecting a range of samples is just to do that with mouse. It works like you are used from other applications just press the LMB; at the point you want to let the selection start and release the button where you want it to end.
If you want to adjust or move the selection's start or end you can move the mouse cursor near to the start or the end of the selection until it changes from the standard arrow cursor into the left-right arrow cursor and then press the LMB; and adjust.

The network kioslave currently only finds and displays devices and services which are actively advertising themselves using the service discovery framework DNS-SD.
nfs
Sun's NFS protocol provides transparent remote access to shared file systems across networks. The NFS protocol is designed to be machine operating system network architecture and transport protocol independent. This independence is achieved through the use of Remote Procedure Call (RPC) primitives built on top of an eXternal Data Representation (XDR).
The supporting MOUNT protocol performs the operating system-specific functions that allow clients to attach remote folder trees to a point within the local file system. The mount process also allows the server to grant remote access privileges to a restricted set of clients via export control.
The Lock Manager provides support for file locking when used in the NFS environment. The Network Lock Manager (NLM) protocol isolates the inherently stateful aspects of file locking into a separate protocol.
A Word about Grouping Contacts
kopete; lets you create groups to sort your contacts. A contact may be in more than one group. Where possible groupings are saved on server side contact lists so if you use other im; programs group memberships are kept in sync. However if you change groups in another im; program kopete; cannot know to move a metacontact automatically; it is up to you to resolve this by hand.
To change the group a metacontact appears in you can use its context menu to move it or copy it to a new group or remove it from a group. You can also use drag and drop here - just drop the metacontact on a different group name.
Adding Contacts
To add a contact either select FileAdd Contact or click the Add button on the toolbar. This brings up the Add Contact Wizard.
To add custom notifications for a contact right click that contact in the Contact List and select Properties. This lets you start chats play a custom sound effect or display a message for that contact or group. Otherwise you can use the Execute a program notification to perform custom notifications. As an example if you have XOSD (X On-Screen Display) installed you can get OSD online notifications by executing the following command when the User goes online event takes place
OhReally at the kde; Forum suggests having your online notifications read out by a speech synthesizer using MBROLA like so
The 'sed' in the middle phoneticises kopete;'s output to so the synthesizer has a better Dutch pronunciation.
Notify all open chats when I go away
Be careful if you enable this item; it will cause a message to be sent to open chats when you become away which some people may find intrusive.
When to authenticate
You should authenticate a buddy the very first time that you talk to them using OTR. If you don't then you cannot really be sure that someone else isn't impersonating them or trying to listen in on your conversation. However once you've authenticated your buddy once you don't have to do it again. OTR will automatically do the authentication for all of your future conversations with that buddy.
The only exceptions occur when your buddy switches between multiple computers or multiple im; accounts. In this case you will need to authenticate once for each computer and account. Once you've done this your buddy can freely use any of the computers you've authenticated them on and OTR will recognize them automatically. If your buddy uses a new computer or account that OTR does not recognize a message will pop up in your conversation window telling you about it.
How to authenticate
To authenticate someone open a conversation with them and click on "Authenticate Contact" on the OTR button. A wizard will be shown asking you what authentication method you would like to use. Please follow the steps in this wizard.

Managing an Encryption Operation
The encryption operation will take some time depending on the number of files and on their size. You can track the progress of the operation from the notification applet provided by plasma;. From the notification plasmoid you can also abort the encryption operation if necessary.
DECRYPTION
You can decrypt one or more encrypted files by writing their paths after the decrypt option. You can also select them in dolphin; or plasma; Folder View and click the Decrypt entry in the context menu. Note that this entry will be visible only when selecting encrypted files.
Managing a Decryption Operation
The folder under which the module should be checked out. Note that the working copy toplevel folder is named after the module you are retrieving unless you give it an alternative name in the Check out as field.
This results in the working copy files being checked out to an alternative folder under the working folder rather than a folder named after the module.
If you check this box the files will be exported rather than checked out. Exporting obtains a copy of the source for the module without the CVS; administrative folders. For example export may be used to prepare the source code for a release.
Checkout all files and folders recursively.
The Main Screen Viewing File Status and Updating
After setting the output format cervisia; generates the patch and displays the Save As dialog. Enter in this dialog the file name and location of the patch file.
Watching an Annotated View of a File
With the command cvs annotate CVS; offers the possibility to see - for each line in a file - who has modified a line the most recently. This view may be helpful in order to find out who has introduced a change in the behavior of a program or who should be asked about some change or bug in the code.
cervisia; gives you access to this feature but it further enriches the information in an interactive way. You obtain an annotate view by choosing ViewAnnotate. Another possibility is to press the button Annotate in the Browse log dialog in which you can select which version of the file you want to display. In  you can see a screenshot of the dialog.
A screenshot of cervisia;'s annotate dialog
An editing session is automatically ended when you commit the affected file. At that moment an unedit notification gets sent out to all people who have registered a respective watch on the file. Of course sometimes you may not want to commit the file but abort the editing session and revert to the previous version of the file. This is done by using AdvancedUnedit Files. Note that cervisia; will not ask you for confirmation; that means if you use this menu item all your work done since you used AdvancedEdit Files will be lost. Precisely cervisia; uses the command line
echo y | cvs unedit file names
So far we have only discussed the case where edits and unedits are used voluntarily be the developers. In addition CVS; supports a model which enforces the usage of these commands. The responsible command to switch to this model is cvs watch on which we will not explain further because it is mostly used by the administrator of the repository. However the important point from the developer's point of view is that when the project enforces edits working copies are checked out readonly. That means you cannot edit a file by default (unless you use tricks like chmod). Only when you use AdvancedEdit Files the file becomes writable. It is made read-only again when you commit the file or use AdvancedUnedit Files.
cervisia;'s editor interface helps you with projects that enforce watches also in a different way. If you just started an editor with a readonly file by double-clicking on it or by using FileEdit you would not be able to save your modifications later. This has of course a reason Whenever you want to change a file you should run cvs edit before so that all people watching the file get a notification that you are working on it.
In such a case it is advisable to check the option SettingsDo cvs edit Automatically When Necessary. Now whenever you edit a file by double-clicking it cervisia; will run cvs edit before the editor is actually executed. Then you can edit your file as usual. When you have finished your work commit your files and the committed files are read-only again.

Using kompare; the second person can view the diff file compare it to the local copy of the document and apply the changes made by the first person. So the process can go on for many versions of the document each person making changes creating diffs distributing them and applying them. This process is commonly called patching  a term taken from the program named patch which is another command line tool specifically designed for the purpose of applying diff files.
It sometimes happens that people edit a file at the same time. In this situation it is likely that people will make changes in the document at exactly the same line. This creates a problem because without applied caution people could be overwriting each others work as they apply the diff files they receive. Fortunately the developers of the diff and patch programs took this into consideration and so these tools will not allow such changes to be applied without manual intervention. When this state is reached it is known as a conflict . kompare; will display conflicts so that you can manually resolve them deciding which changes should be applied to which file.
kompare; is also a great program for comparison of file changes on a folder level. When used to compare folders kompare; recursively examines subfolders and their file contents for differences. In this use case each file where differences are found are automatically opened and listed by kompare; where easy navigation between the various files is possible.
Using kompare;
This section provides instructions for starting kompare; and provides a quick tour to the kompare; main interface.

The main default lokalize; window
This shows the default window when a file is opened.
The top-left part of the main window shows the Translation Units. Below this there is Unit Metadata section and it contains comments relevant to the currently displayed source text. In the lower-left there is a Translation Memory section which shows the suggested translations from the translation memory database for the current source text entry. On the lower-right corner of the window the glossary section is shown.
Translation files are opened in separate tabs with two big multi-line edits as well as a bunch of tool views. These views can be stacked (similar to tabs) shown separately or hidden. Translation files consist of many English-target pairs called units. A unit typically correspond to a single string in the user interface or one paragraph in the documentation. The purpose of the first multi-line edit is to display the original part of the pair. The purpose of the second multi-line edit is to display the translation. You can navigate through the units via the Translation Units view or by using Page Down and Page Up.
A unit may be translated or untranslated. A translation of a translated unit may be ready or not ready (also called fuzzy sometimes). If the unit is not ready its translation is rendered in italics. lokalize; allows you to easily navigate through the file according to the state of their translation. See Go menu for the shortcuts. The status bar at the bottom of the window shows the current string number total number of strings total untranslated strings total not ready (fuzzy) strings and status of the current string respectively. When navigating untranslated units are treated as not ready. Also you may use the filtering feature of Translation Units toolview. Pressing Page Down actually takes you to the next unit in filtered/sorted list of that tool view.

All you need to do is to select which folders you want to store. This is done by selecting all the folders in the tree view on the left side of the main window.
If you select a folder kbackup; will automatically store all files and subfolders below it. If you want to exclude parts of a selected folder simply deselect that files/folders inside the still selected folder.
In general this means A selected folder will store everything in it and below it except the deselected parts in it. This also means whenever you reuse a profile (see below) later on and new files have been added to a folder already selected for backup all the new files will also be stored.
Here's a screenshot of kbackup;

This value indicates how much you trust the owner of this key to correctly verify the identity of the keys he signs. Taking the owner trust into account gpg creates your own web of trust. You trust the keys you signed. If you assign owner trust to these persons you will also trust the keys they have signed without the need that you first have to sign their keys too.
Signing keys
When you sign a key of someone else (let's call her Alice) you announce that you are sure that this key really belongs to that person and the key can be trusted. Of course you really should have checked that. This usually means that you have to meet Alice check at least one identity card and get the full key fingerprint or a copy of her key. Then you go home and sign that key. Usually you will later upload the newly signed key to a key server so everyone knows you have checked that key and the owner may be trusted. Alice will likely do the same so you both will have your keys signed by the other one. If one of you has no identity card at hand it's no problem if the signing happens in only direction.
But think about what happens if Alice lives on the other end of the world. You communicate with her regularly but there is no chance you will see her anytime soon. How do you trust her key?
When you select her key and then choose Sign Key you will get the dialog that allows you to choose the options how you would like to sign that key.

Template Edit Dialog
The Template Edit dialog is similar to the Alarm Edit dialog. The following controls are different
Enter the template's name in Template name. It is the template's name which is displayed in template selection lists so it is best to choose a name which will remind you of its function. Each template's name must be unique.
In the Time group box select one of
Default time if you do not wish to specify any trigger time. Alarms based on this template will initially use the normal default trigger time for new alarms.
When the message was displaying at the time you logged off and is then restored when you log back in.
When a recurring alarm triggers but the alarm message (or a deferred alarm message) from a previous occurrence of the alarm is still visible; in other words when the previous occurrence of the alarm has not yet been acknowledged.
The pre-alarm action can be used to control whether to display the alarm message
Check Cancel alarm on error to cancel the alarm if the pre-alarm command returns an error status. This will prevent the alarm message from being displayed and any post-alarm action from being executed.
Normally if the pre-alarm command returns an error an error message is displayed and an error indication is shown in the alarm list. These error notifications can be prevented by checking Do not notify errors.
If kmail;'s indexes are regenerated the link to the email in kmail; will be lost.
The button showing the kalarm; icon provides a convenient way to activate kalarm;.
You can choose in the Configuration dialog which of two different modes should be used to display alarm message windows
As a normal window. In this mode the keyboard focus is taken by the alarm message window when it appears so if you are typing at the time your keystrokes will be diverted to it rather than your original application.
As a non-modal window. In this mode the keyboard focus is unaffected when the alarm message window appears so it will not interfere with your typing. However in this mode the window has no titlebar or frame so you cannot move it or resize it.
Daily end time enter the time at which you finish work each day.
KOrganizer event duration Enter the event duration to set in korganizer; for alarms which are copied to korganizer;. The default duration is zero.
The Storage section lets you choose options for saving and archiving alarms
New Alarms amp; Templates Specify which calendar to store new alarms and alarm templates in when using multiple alarm calendars
Store in default calendar New alarms and alarm templates are automatically added to the default alarm calendar without prompting for confirmation.
-m --mail address
Send an email to the specified address. This option may be repeated as necessary. --exec --exec-display and --file cannot be specified with this option. --ack-confirm --beep --color and --colorfg are ignored with this option.
-p --play URL
Specify the path or URL; of an audio file to be played once either as an audio alarm or when the alarm message is displayed. --play-repeat --beep and --speak cannot be specified with this option.
-P --play-repeat URL
If the scheduled time (including any repetitions) has already passed kalarm; immediately displays the message (unless the lateCancel value indicates that it is now too late to display the alarm in which case kalarm; ignores the request). If the scheduled time (or a repetition) is in the future kalarm; adds the alarm message to the default active alarm calendar for later display.
scheduleFile
schedule a new alarm which displays the contents of a text or image file.
Specifies the text or image file whose contents are to be displayed in the message to be scheduled.
Specifies the logical OR of the desired alarm flags. The flag bits are those defined in class KAlarmIface in kalarmiface.h. Note that not all flag bits are applicable to file alarms.

You can find a quick introduction to the Identities page in the Getting Started section.
This page allows you to create one or more Identities ie; combinations of name email address and other settings. For example you can create one identity for business communication and one for personal communication. If you have more than one email address you can create one identity per address. You will then be able to select an identity on a per-message basis.
The page consists of a list of identities and buttons to manage them. The identities list will always show at least one identity which is then the Default identity.
To add a new identity to the identity list click on the Add button.

By default Visible by default is checked uncheck it if you only want the column to be available on the RMB; add or remove menu for the clickable sort bar. Then drag the appropriate label from the Content Items to the column view box under the column bar eg; if you chose to add a size column you would drag the Size label to underneath the Size column. Continue to do this until you have all the columns you desire. You can change the font and color of column items through the view area RMB; menu. Move delete and resize columns through the RMB; menu of the column bar.
The Advanced tab allows you to change whether to show headers. You can also change the size of status icons.
If checked kmail; will show a warning if for whatever reason a message would be sent without being digitally signed.
If checked kmail; will show a warning if for whatever reason a message would be sent without being encrypted.
While it is common to sign all outgoing messages encrypting them is not. So unless your company has a policy of never sending any unencrypted messages it might be a good idea to keep this option switched off and rely on opportunistic encryption to alert you if you could send encrypted messages but did not request it.
If checked kmail; will emit a warning if an smime; certificate or openpgp; key will be used for a recipient whose email address is not listed in the email addresses stored in the certificate.
Situations in which this warning will trigger include when configuring your per-identity openpgp; keys or smime; certificates when encrypting and when verifying signatures if the signature was made with a certificate that does not include the email address of the sender.

Symptom You are using kmail; on a netbook and find that the new Aggregation display leaves you little screen space
SolutionIf you want to change the look so that a mail uses a single row instead of two rows go to ViewMessage ListTheme and change the theme to Classic. If you want to disable grouping by date change the aggregation using ViewMessage ListAggregation to Standard Mailing List. Now your kmail; will look exactly like it did in earlier versions.
In SettingsConfigure KMailAppearanceFonts you can select Use custom fonts and change the setting for each component in the list. This is when you discover that your folder list and the message bodies do use the fonts you want but the message list still has too large a font.
You can make the font changes by right-clicking on the Message List headers and selecting ThemeConfigureAppearance tab. Each one of those column headers needs to be clicked on and your new custom font set. At the end of this the message list will display in the same font as the rest of your layout.

Screenshot of Folder Archive
Folder Archive is used to archive single emails to a specified folder. For instance you need to archive all of those pesky bill receipts in one place. Folder Archive can easily accommodate those needs. Start by using SettingsConfigure Folder Archive Agent in kmail;'s reader window to open a dialog to set up the folder archive agent.
This dialog will have a tab for each of your configured accounts including Local Folders and you will need to configure all accounts that you wish to use this feature with. The first option allows you to enable/disable the folder archive agent. It is disabled by default to enable check the Enable checkbox. You can set the location of your Archive folder by clicking the folder icon next to Folder and selecting the folder you wish to use. For example you could create a folder called bill receipts by clicking the New Subfolder and typing bill receipts in the dialog. You may choose a folder location anywhere eg;.. a folder in your Local Folders or on your imap; server.
You have several choices on how the emails will be archived

You can export your data as an iCalendar file which is supported by most scheduling applications. korganizer; will export all calendar items from the enabled (checked) resources which are not filtered out (let's call these items active items). In other words if you cannot see a calendar item it won't be in the exported file. To filter out the undesired items before exporting them you can create filters. Filters are even more effective if you classify your events and to-dos in categories. To enable and disable resources check or uncheck the resource box in the Calendar Manager  sidebar.
To export all your active events to-dos and journal entries (independent of to what resource they belong) as a new iCalendar file choose the FileExport Export as iCalendar menu item. The Save As dialog will pop up. Enter the file name and location for the new file to complete the export action.

Contemporary computers have ample storage space. However if you synchronize your korganizer; calendar with a limited-memory machine like the Palm device you will find archiving useful. The performance of korganizer; can also become worse when there are many events. To archive old items follow the procedure below
Choose the FileArchive Old Entries menu item.
Attendee list
The list in the center of the tab displays the attendees selected for this event and lets you add attendees by entering the name and mail address edit or remove them.
If the attendee(s) are in your Address Book you do not have to remember or type his email address to add it to the attendee list. Just click the Select Addressee button and choose the attendee(s) from the list. Please note that this is the standard kde; address book which is also used by kmail; and can also be called as a separate application (kaddressbook;).
Choose the role of the attendee (Participant Optional Participant Observer Chair) from the drop down menu at the left side of an entry. The role is a simple reminder of what part the attendee plays in this event.
Choose the status of the attendee (Needs Action Accepted Declined Tentative Delegated) from the drop down menu at the right side of an entry. If you use groupware schedule and request responses from your attendees as you receive the responses the status of the attendee will be updated. If you do not request responses you will have to update the status manually.
In the next input field enter Peter Krzinski #060;pkrzinski@thiscompany.com#062;.
In the next input field enter Kirsten Friese #060;kfriese@thiscompany.com#062;.
If you have configured korganizer; to use groupware communication you will be asked if you want to send an email to the attendees with details of the event and asking for a response if the Request response box from the Attendees tab is checked. Else you can send the invitations choosing the Schedule Send Invitation to Attendees menu item.
Review the event setup by clicking on the tabs. If you are satisfied click OK.
Congratulations you've scheduled your first event!
Enter the login information relative to your account on the server
Kolab2 server specificity your registered UID (Unique IDentifier) by default would be similar to your email address on the Kolab2 server but it may be different. In this case enter your UID. Ask the server administrator about your UID if you do not know it.
Enter your password (server login password) here.
Check this option if you want korganizer; to remember your password and skip asking you each time it uploads your Free/Busy information.
It is not recommended to store your password in the configuration file for security reasons.
 Go Week
Switch the display to the Week view.
The Week view provides a view similar to the Day view. Events for seven days are shown next to each other. All of the functions available for the Day view are available in the Week view too.

kwatchgnupg; is simple gnupg; log viewer for the gnupg; versions 1.4 2.0 and 2.1. It works as a GUI; wrapper around the command line tool watchgnupg; which listens on a socket for log lines from the gnupg; backend applications. See info watchgnupg for more information about watchgnupg;.
kwatchgnupg; can be started from the ToolsGnuPG Log Viewer menu of both kleopatra; and kmail; as well as from the command line. The kwatchgnupg; executable is named kwatchgnupg.
Viewing the Log
kwatchgnupg;'s main function is of course to present the gnupg; debugging and logging information to the user. The main window is divided into a large text viewing area where gnupg; messages will appear as they are generated a toolbar giving quick access to the most often needed functions as well as the obligatory menu bar.
Each line in the text view is normally prefixed with a FD identifier and a time stamp in ISO format. The FD identifier can be used to distinguish between output from different gnupg; instances running in parallel. Following the timestamp is the name of the component that is the source of the log line together with some internal information in sqare brackets followed by the original debugging or log output as printed by the component.

The most important part of the editor is of course the editing area this is the area where you draw your regular expression. This area is the larger gray one in the middle.
Above the editing area you have two Toolbars the first one contains the editing actions - much like drawing tools in a drawing program. The second Toolbar contains the What's This? button and buttons for undo and redo.
Below the editing area you find the regular expression currently build in the so called ascii syntax. The ascii syntax is updated while you edit the regular expression in the graphical editor. If you rather want to update the ascii syntax then please do the graphical editor is updated on the fly to reflect your changes.
Finally to the left of the editor area you will find a number of pre-built regular expressions. They serve two purposes (1) When you load the editor with a regular expression then this regular expression is made nicer or more comprehensive by replacing common regular expressions. In the screen dump above you can see how the ascii syntax ".*" have been replaced with a box saying "anything". (2) When you insert regular expression you may find building blocks for your own regular expression from the set of pre build regular expressions. See the section on user defined regular expressions to learn how to save your own regular expressions.

If you have ideas remarks or questions or if you just need help
You can close Cvpcb and go back to the Eeschema schematic editor. Save the project by clicking on *File* -> **Save Whole Schematic Project**. Close the schematic editor.
Switch to the KiCad project manager.
The netlist file describes all components and their respective pin connections. The netlist file is actually a text file that you can easily inspect edit or script.
Library files (*.lib) are text files too and they are also easily editable or scriptable.
To create a Bill Of Materials (BOM) go to the Eeschema schematic editor and click on the 'Bill of materials' icon imageimages/icons/bom.png[bompng] on the top toolbar.  By default there is no plugin active. You add one by clicking on *Add Plugin* button. Select the *.xsl file you want to use in this case we select bom2csv.xsl.
Click on the 'Browse Netlist Files' button select the netlist file in the file selection dialogue and click on 'Read Current Netlist'.  Then click the 'Close' button.
At this point you should be able to see a layout with all previous components already routed. On the top left corner you should see all unrouted components in our case the CON2. Select CON2 with the mouse.  Move the component to the middle of the board.
Place CON2 and route it. Once done save and proceed with the Gerber file generation as usual.
The process described here can easily be repeated as many times as you need. Beside the Forward Annotation method described above there is another method known as Backward Annotation. This method allows you to make modifications to your already routed PCB from Pcbnew and updates those modifications in your schematic and netlist file. The Backward Annotation method however is not that useful and is therefore not described here.

In the example above (scroll up please) you can search for the number of children whose name starts with an E or a subsequent letter. Edit the formula in B16 to read =DCOUNTA(A1E10;"Name";A13E14). Delete the old search criteria and enter >=E under Name in field A14. The result is 5. If you now delete all number values for Greta in row 8 the result changes to 4. Row 8 is no longer included in the count because it does not contain any values. The name Greta is text not a value. Note that the DatabaseField parameter must point to a column that can contain values.
DGET function         cell contents;searching in Calc databases         searching;cell contents in Calc databases
DGET returns the contents of the referenced cell in a database which matches the specified search criteria. In case of an error the function returns either #VALUE! for no row found or Err502 for more than one cell found.
DGET(Database; DatabaseField; SearchCriteria)
In the above example (scroll up please) we want to determine what grade a child is in whose name was entered in cell A14. The formula is entered in cell B16 and differs slightly from the earlier examples because only one column (one database field) can be entered for DatabaseField. Enter the following formula
ACCRINTM function         accrued interests;one-off payments
Calculates the accrued interest of a security in the case of one-off payment at the settlement date.

Guess (optional) is the estimated value. An iterative method is used to calculate the internal rate of return. If you can provide only few values you should provide an initial guess to enable the iteration.
=ISEVENADD(5) returns 0.
=ISEVENADD(A1) returns 1 if cell A1 contains the number 2.
ISNONTEXT function  cell contents;no text
Tests if the cell contents are text or numbers and returns FALSE if the contents are text.
If an error occurs the function returns TRUE.
v = value. Value result of a formula as a number
Returns the width of the referenced column. The unit is the number of zeros (0) that fit into the column in the default text and the default size.
Returns the alignment of the referenced cell.
' = align left or left-justified
" = align right
ACOT function
Returns the inverse cotangent (the arccotangent) of the given number.
ACOT(Number)
This function returns the inverse trigonometric cotangent of Number that is the angle (in radians) whose cotangent is Number. The angle returned is between 0 and PI.
=ACOT(1) returns 0.785398163397448 (PI/4 radians).
Negative numbers round down to the integer below.
=INT(5.7) returns 5.
=INT(-1.3) returns -2.
EVEN function  numbers;rounding up/down to even integers  rounding;up/down to even integers
Rounds a positive number up to the next even integer and a negative number down to the next even integer.
M is the increment to increase N
Coefficients is a series of coefficients. For each coefficient the series sum is extended by one section.
PRODUCT function  numbers;multiplying  multiplying;numbers
Multiplies all the numbers given as arguments and returns the product.
PRODUCT(Number1; Number2; ; Number30)
SumRange is the range from which values are summed. If this parameter has not been indicated the values found in the Range are summed.
SUMIF supports the reference concatenation operator () only in the Criteria parameter and only if the optional SumRange parameter is not given.
To sum up only negative numbers =SUMIF(A1A10;"
=SUMIF(A1A10;">0";B110) - sums values from the range B1B10 only if the corresponding values in the range A1A10 are >0.
See COUNTIF() for some more syntax examples that can be used with SUMIF().
Comparison operators in an array formula treat empty cells in the same way as in a normal formula that is either as zero or as an empty string. For example if cells A1 and A2 are empty the array formulas {=A1A2=""} and {=A1A2=0} will both return a 1 column 2 row array of cells containing TRUE.
When do you use array formulas?
Use array formulas if you have to repeat calculations using different values. If you decide to change the calculation method later you only have to update the array formula. To add an array formula select the entire array range and then make the required change to the array formula.
Array formulas are also a space saving option when several values must be calculated since they are not very memory-intensive. In addition arrays are an essential tool for carrying out complex calculations because you can have several cell ranges included in your calculations. $[officename] has different math functions for arrays such as the MMULT function for multiplying two arrays or the SUMPRODUCT function for calculating the scalar products of two arrays.

=AVERAGEIFS(C2C6;B2B6;">"MIN(B2B6);B2B6;"
Calculates the average for values of the range C2C6 that correspond to all values of the range B2B6 except its minimum and maximum. Returns 127.5 because the third and fifth rows do not meet at least one criterion.
=AVERAGEIFS(C2C6;A2A6;"pen.*";B2B6;"
Calculates the average for values of the range C2C6 that correspond to all cells of the A2A6 range starting with "pen" and to all cells of the B2B6 range except its maximum. Returns 65 because only second row meets all criteria.
If you need to change a criterion easily you may want to specify it in a separate cell and use a reference to this cell in the condition of AVERAGEIFS function. For example the above function can be rewritten as follows
EOMONTH(StartDate; Months)
StartDate is a date (the starting point of the calculation).
What is the last day of the month that falls 6 months after September 14 2001?
=EOMONTH(DATE(2001;9;14);6) returns the serial number 37346. Formatted as a date this is 2002-03-31.
=EOMONTH("2001-09-14";6) works as well. If the date is given as string it has to be in ISO format.
MONTH function
Returns the month for the given date value. The month is returned as an integer between 1 and 12.
MONTH(Number)
Number as a time value is a decimal for which the month is to be returned.
=MONTH(NOW()) returns the current month.
=WEEKNUM(DATE(1999;1;1);21) returns 53. Week 1 starts on Monday 1999-01-04.

The Tab order property is not available to Hidden Controls. If you want you can also set this property for image buttons and image controls so that you can select these controls with the Tab key.
When creating a form an index is automatically assigned to the control fields that are added to this form; every control field added is assigned an index increased by 1. If you change the index of a control the indices of the other controls are updated automatically. Elements that cannot be focused (Tabstop = No) are also assigned a value. However these controls are skipped when using the Tab key.
You can also easily define the indices of the different controls in the Tab Order dialog.
Sets whether the value changes when the user scrolls a mouse wheel. Never No change of the value. When focused (default) The value changes when the control has the focus and the wheel is pointing at the control and gets scrolled. Always The value changes when the wheel is pointing at the control and gets scrolled no matter which control has the focus.
Specifies whether an option or a check box is selected by default.
In the case of database forms the data source determines the entries of the list or combo box. Depending on the selected type you have a choice between different data sources under List content provided that these objects exist in your database. All available database objects of the type selected under Type of list contents are offered here. If you have selected the "Value List" option as the type you can use references for database forms. If the display of the control is controlled by an SQL command the SQL statement is entered here.
Examples of SQL statements
For list boxes an SQL statement may have the following form
SELECT field1 field2 FROM table
Here "table" is the table whose data is displayed in the list of the control (list table). "field1" is the data field that defines the visible entries in the form; its content is displayed in the list box. "field2" is the field of the list table that is linked to the form table (value table) through the field specified under Data field if Bound field = 1 was selected.
Select the mode of linking a list box with a linked cell on a spreadsheet.

Determines how the navigation should be done using the tab key. Using the tab key you can move forward in the form. If you simultaneously press the Shift key the navigation will follow the opposite direction. If you reach the last (or the first) field and press the tab key again it can have various effects. Define the key control with the following options
This setting automatically defines a cycle which follows an existing database link If the form contains a database link the Tab key will by default initiate a change to the next or previous record on exit from the last field (see All Records). If there is no database link the next/previous form is shown (see Current Page).
This option applies to database forms only and is used to navigate through all records. If you use the Tab key to exit from the last field of a form the current record is changed.
This option applies to database forms only and is used to navigate within the current record. If you use the Tab key to exit from the last field of a form the current record is changed.
On exit from the last field of a form the cursor skips to the first field in the next form. This is standard for HTML forms; therefore this option is especially relevant for HTML forms.

In the options area for WebCast select the Active Server Pages (ASP) option. You can now continue defining other settings or start the export by clicking the Create button.
Using ASP WebCast
You can use WebCast as soon as the exported files can be accessed from an HTTP server.
Let's assume that you installed the Microsoft Internet Information Server on your computer. You entered the "c\Inet\wwwroot\presentation" directory as an HTML output directory during the IIS setup. The URL of your computer is assumed as follows "http//myserver.com".
You have saved the files that have been created during the Export process in the c\Inet\wwwroot\presentation\ directory. In this directory the Export creates an HTML file that can be named for example as "secret.htm". You entered this name in the Save dialog (see above). The presenter can now browse to the HTML Export files by entering the http//myserver.com/presentation/secret.htm URL in any HTTP Browser having JavaScript support. The presenter is now able to modify the page using some form controls.
The Document Converter Wizard contains the following pages
Document Converter Summary
Displays a summary which shows what will be converted when you click Convert.
Document Converter Page 1
Specifies the type of Microsoft Office documents that will be converted.
Allows you to open the query design in the SQL Mode and to interpret the query as a Native SQL. You can only quit the native SQL mode when the $[officename] statement is completely interpreted (only possible if the used tables or fields in the query really exist).
Do not open the query
Allows you to cancel the procedure and specify that the query should not be opened. This option corresponds to the function of the Cancel dialog button.
Also ignore similar errors
If you selected the first option but you still want to open the query in the graphics view in spite of missing elements you can specify whether other errors are ignored. Therefore in the current opening process no error message will be displayed if the query can not be correctly interpreted.
Applies only distinct values to the query. This applies to records containing data that appears several times in the selected fields. If the Distinct Values command is active you will see only one record in the query (DISTINCT). Otherwise you will see all records corresponding to the query criteria (ALL).
For example if the name "Smith" occurs several times in your address database you can choose the Distinct Values command to specify in the query that the name "Smith" will occur only once.
For a query involving several fields the combination of values from all fields must be unique so that the result can be formed from a specific record. For example you have "Smith in Chicago" once in your address book and "Smith in London" twice. With the Distinct Values command the query will use the two fields "last name" and "city" and return the query result "Smith in Chicago" once and "Smith in London" once.
In SQL this command corresponds to the DISTINCT predicate.
Allows you to maximize the number of records with which query returns.
Tables involved
Specifies two different tables that you want to join.
Fields involved
Specifies two data fields that will be joined by a relation.
Specifies the link type of the selected link. Some databases support only a subset of the possible types.

When you insert or delete cells rows or columns in a table the Behavior of rows/columns options determine how the neighboring elements are affected. For example you can only insert new rows and columns into a table with fixed row and column dimensions if space permits.
Note that these properties are valid only for changes to the column width that are made using the keyboard. Using the mouse you are free to make any column width changes.
Fixed - changes only affect the adjacent cell and not the entire table. For example when you widen a cell the adjacent cell becomes narrower but the width of the table remains constant.
Fixed proportional - changes affect the entire table and wide cells shrink more than narrow cells. For example when you widen a cell the adjacent cells become proportionally narrower but the width of the table remains constant.
Variable - changes affect the table size. For example when you widen a cell the width of the table increases.

If you still cannot boot try one of the following solutions
Try ``nouveau.noaccel=1`` instead of ``nomodeset``.
After the installation use menuselection`Advanced Options --> Recovery mode` from the boot menu and choose ``resume``.
Install an older release
If your computer has compatibility issues with the latest Linux Mint release install a previous release from the same Linux Mint series.
The best place to find help is on the `Linux Mint Forums `.
Search the forums before asking in case someone else already asked the same question.
The chat room
Another great place to find help is in the IRC chat room.
To reach the chat room from within Linux Mint launch menuselection`Menu --> Internet --> HexChat`.
A Linux Mint operating system takes about 15GB and grows as you install additional software. If you can spare the size give it 100GB. Keep most of your free space for the home partition. User data (downloads videos pictures) takes a lot more space.

This program extracts specific parts from a matroska; file to other useful formats. The first argument is the name of the source file which must be a matroska; file.
All other arguments either switch to a certain extraction mode change options for the currently active mode or specify what to extract into which file.  Multiple modes can be used in the same invocation of mkvextract allowing the extraction of multiple things in a single pass.  Most options can only be used in certain modes with a few options applying to all modes.
Currently supported is the extraction of tracks tags attachments chapters CUE sheets timestamps and cues.
The following options are available in all modes and only described once in this section.

--split parts-000245000550-
Examples 
The parts mode tells mkvmerge; to keep certain ranges of timestamps while discarding others. The ranges to keep have to be listed after the parts keyword and be separated by commas. A range itself consists of a start and an end timestamp in the same format the other variations of --split accept (e.g. both 000120 and 80s refer to the same timestamp).
If a start timestamp is left out then it defaults to the previous range's end timestamp. If there was no previous range then it defaults to the start of the file (see example 3).
If an end timestamp is left out then it defaults to the end of the source files which basically tells mkvmerge; to keep the rest (see example 3).

Sets the video projection method used. Valid values are 0 (rectangular projection) 1 (equirectangular projection) 2 (cubemap projection) and 3 (mesh projection).
--projection-private TIDdata
Sets private data that only applies to a specific projection. Data must be given as hex numbers with or without the quot;0xquot; prefix with or without spaces.
--projection-pose-yaw TIDfloat
--projection-pose-pitch TIDfloat
AVI files The video track has the ID 0. The audio tracks get IDs in ascending order starting at 1.
AAC AC-3 MP3 SRT and WAV files The one 'track' in that file gets the ID 0.
Most other files The track IDs are assigned in order the tracks are found in the file starting at 0.
The special track ID '-1' is a wild card and applies the given switch to all tracks that are read from an input file.
The options that use the track IDs are the ones whose description contains 'TID'.  The following options use track IDs as well --audio-tracks --video-tracks --subtitle-tracks --button-tracks and --track-tags.
The shortest possible matroska; file would look like this
[EBML head] [segment [segment information] [track information] [cluster 1]]
This might be the case for audio-only files.
External timestamp files
mkvmerge; allows the user to chose the timestamps for a specific track himself. This can be used in order to create files with variable frame rate video or include gaps in audio. A frame in this case is the unit that mkvmerge; creates separately per matroska; block. For video this is exactly one frame for audio this is one packet of the specific audio type. E.g. for AC-3 this would be a packet containing 1536 samples.
Replacing the tags for the second subtitle track in a file looks like this
$ mkvpropedit movie.mkv --tags tracks2new-subtitle-tags.xml
Removing all tags requires leaving out the file name
$ mkvpropedit movie.mkv --tags all
Replacing the chapters in a file looks like this

If you have unused space on an existing Windows partition the installer may offer to use it.
This can be a useful way of making room for your new Mageia installation but is a risky operation so you should make sure you have backed up all important files!
Note that this involves shrinking the size of the Windows partition. The partition must be "clean" meaning that Windows must have closed down correctly the last time it was used. It must also have been defragmented although this is not a guarantee that all files in the partition have been moved out of the area that is about to be used. It is highly recommended to back up your personal files.
Erase and use Entire Disk.
Note! This will erase ALL data on the selected hard drive. Take care!
Setup SCSI
DrakX should then be able to configure the drive(s) correctly.
The default driver should work without problems. However if after install you do encounter problems then run draksound or start this tool via MCC (Mageia Control Center) by choosing the Hardware tab and clicking on Sound Configuration at the top right of the screen.

You can start this tool from the command line by typing diskdrake --nfs as root.
This tool allows you to declare some shared directories to be accessible to all users on the machine. The protocol used for this is NFS which is available on most Linux or Unix systems. The shared directory will be thus available directly at boot. Shared directories can be also accessible directly in a single session for a user with tools such as file browsers.
Select search servers to obtain a list of servers which share directories.
Click on the > symbol before the server name to display the list of the shared directories and select the directory you want to access.

https//wiki.mageia.org/en/FeatureMageiaWelcome
We've added two new desktop environments Mate and Cinnamon both available from the classic installer DVD/ISO. To make it more friendly we re-factored the custom desktop choice.
There's been a lot of work done on Mageia software. Many packages were ported from Gtk2 to Gtk3 to use more modern components. We've also ported all the tools from the deprecated usermode to polkit when privileges are needed.
TexLive used to need around 1GB of data for installation - now it's separated into 3 packages which will usually mean a much smaller footprint.
Mageia is both a Community and a Linux Distribution with Mageia 4 being our fourth release.
As a contributor you should aim to collaborate with other community members as well as with other communities (upstream projects for instance) that are interested in or depend on the work you do. Your work should be transparent and be fed back into the community as quickly as possible (even when not fully completed). If you wish to work on something new in existing projects keep those projects team informed of your ideas and progress.
It may not always be possible to reach consensus on the implementation of an idea so don't feel obliged to achieve this before you begin. However always ensure that you keep the outside world informed of your work and publish it in a way that allows outsiders to test discuss and contribute to your efforts.
Contributors to every project come and go. When you leave or disengage from the project in whole or in part you should do so with pride about what you have achieved and by acting responsibly towards others who come after you to continue working on the project.
As a user your feedback is important as is its form. Poorly considered comments can cause pain and demotivate other community members but considerate discussion of problems can bring positive results. An encouraging word works wonders.
Be pragmatic.
Mageia will be compliant with open source standards.
Mageia will always adhere to high security and privacy standards/technologies to protect our users' data.
Mageia is Open Relations
We will secure the future of the distribution through its community.
We will cooperate with other OSS distributions and core and kernel developers with code contribution.

Soft Takeover Use this option for knobs or sliders to avoid sudden jumps in value when the knob in the term`GUI` doesn't match the physical knob.  If you select this option you won't be able to perform super-fast motions as easily. (Recommended off)
Invert  Use this option for controls that you want to work backwards from how they were detected.
Switch Mode Use this option on controllers that have controls that act like switches and emit one value on the first press and a different value on the next press. (Think an actual hardware toggle switch or a button that lights up on the first press and turns off on the second press).
Jog Wheel / Select Knob  Use this for knobs that don't have a beginning or an end but spin continuously.

--settingsPath PATH
The audio buffer also known as latency is the lag time in milliseconds that it takes for Mixxx to process your input (turning knobs sliding the crossfader etc.). For example with an audio buffer of 36 ms it will take approximately 36 milliseconds for Mixxx to stop the audio after you toggle the play button. Additionally the audio buffer setting determines how quickly your term`Operating System` expects Mixxx to react. A smaller audio buffer means Mixxx will be more responsive. On the other hand setting your audio buffer too low may be too much for your computer and sound card to handle. In this situation Mixxx playback will be choppy and very clearly distorted as your computer will not be able to keep up with how frequently Mixxx is processing audio.
An audio buffer between 36-64 ms is acceptable if you are using Mixxx with a keyboard/mouse or a controller. An audio buffer below 10 ms is recommended when vinyl control is used because Mixxx will feel unresponsive otherwise.
Keep in mind that *lower latencies require better soundcards and faster CPUs* and that zero latency DJ software is a myth (although Mixxx is capable of sub-1ms operation).
The sample rate setting in Mixxx controls how many samples per second are produced by Mixxx. This determines the maximum frequency in Mixxx's signal which is half the sample rate. Humans can only hear up to 20 kHz so there is generally no need to use more than a 44.1 kHz (44100 Hz) sample rate for playback. Most music is published with a 44100 Hz sample rate.
A sample rate of 96kHz takes Mixxx over twice as long to compute. Keep in mind that increasing the sample rate will increase CPU usage and likely raise the minimum audio buffer size you can use.
**Single Right Click** On most buttons performing a right click triggers a different action than a left click. You can return any knob or fader to its default value by right-clicking that control.
**Mouse Drag** Click on a knob or fader hold the left mouse button and move your cursor to change the value of the control. Use mouse drag to drop tracks from the file list to the decks crates playlists etc.
**Mouse Wheel** Just like Mouse Drag you can change knob and fader values by placing the cursor over the control and moving the mouse wheel.
If you hover with the mouse over a control (e.g the crossfader) in the Mixxx user interface the tooltip lists the left- and right-click action respectively.
On a Macbook or a computer with a touchpad that lacks mouse buttons a two-finger click gesture is often treated as a right click.
Perform your mix
Click the guilabel`Stop Recording` button to stop the recording when the mix has finished.
You can instantly play your recording as track in Mixxx. Simply drag-and-drop the track to a deck.

Mixxx allows you to perform live DJ mixes with your digital music collection. It helps you rock the party with MIDI controllers vinyl turntables or even just your keyboard.
Mixxx is used by professional DJs and bedroom DJs alike. It is designed by an international team of volunteer DJs who want to bring the joy of DJing to everyone. The project is non-profit open-source and community driven. Together and with your help we aim to build the best DJ software ever created.
Mixxx Features
**Customizing the view**
Move columns by clicking in a column header and dragging it to another position. Right-click on a column header to show and hide particular columns. Adjust the column width to fit the contents of the rows by double-clicking on the separator between two column headers.
**Sorting Tracks**
Tracks are automatically sorted by the active column. Click on the active column header to reverse the sort order. Click on another column header to change the active column.
**Rating tracks**
Previewing Tracks
To pre-listen to a track activate the guilabel`Preview` column in a library view. Clicking the |iclibpreviewplay| icon in the library's guilabel`Preview` column loads the selected track in a special ref`Preview Deck ` that will only output sound in the ref`headphones ` channel. Click the |iclibpreviewpause| icon to stop the playback.
Alternatively select a track from the track list of the Mixxx library drag the track to the waveform view of the ref`Preview Deck ` and click the guilabel`Play` button next to the waveform.
To display the Preview deck press kbd`CTRL` + kbd`4` (Windows/Linux) or kbd`CMD` + kbd`4` (Mac).
Edit metadata of audio files
**Add to Auto DJ** Adds the content of the session to the ref`Auto DJ ` queue for automatic mixing.
**Rename** Rename a session default is the calendar date (YYYY-MM-DD).
**Remove** Remove a previous session but not the locked sessions or even the current session.
**Lock** Protect a previous session against accidental merge and deletion. An icon indicates a locked session.
**Create new history playlist** Split off the current history session and add a new session without having to restart Mixxx. The current history must contain at least one track for this option to be available.
Method B Package manager
Another easy way to activate MP3 streaming is to use `Homebrew ` or `MacPorts ` which are package managers like `apt ` on Debian/Ubuntu Linux. They provide a convenient way to install many Open Source packages. Once Homebrew or Macports is installed adding MP3 support to Mixxx is rather simple.
**Homebrew**
Open a terminal and type the following commands
**Macports**
The crossfader is a slider that determines how much each deck of audio contributes to the term`master output`.
cue
A Cue or Cue point is a reference point in the track usually placed on the position the DJ wants the track to start at by default. This is useful to instantly jump to that point without seeking through the track.
cue sheet
A cue sheet (or CUE file CUE sheet etc.) is a formatted plain text file which is used to provide index information for a large audio file. For example it can be used to tell software extra details about the layout of a CD to burn.
An Overview of the Mixxx Interface
Welcome to the Mixxx interface. This is where the magic happens. You are going to want to get very familiar with this interface because it is the main way to use Mixxx. In this chapter we present the default interface of Mixxx and describe its elements knobs and faders.
The Mixxx interface - Deere skin
This is the Deere skin. It is the default skin supplied with Mixxx. There are a variety of others skins included with Mixxx. You should explore them all to figure out which one you prefer. This section will focus on Deere only.
The Deck Sections
Loop Controls
The beatloop and looping controls of the deck
In this section of the Mixxx interface you can control (beat-)loops and set the loop points of a track.
**Beatlooping Buttons**
**Instant loop** The numbered buttons represents a different term`bar` length. Clicking on any of that buttons will set a loop of the defined number of beats from the beat immediately following the current playback position. If a loop is set a loop overlay will be drawn on the ref`waveforms `.
Tapping the Play/Pause button pauses the track at the current position.
**Pioneer mode**
It is basically the same as Mixxx mode but the buttons are more flashy like a Pioneer CDJ player.
The Play/Pause button flashes once per second when a track is paused.
The Cue button flashes twice a second when the next push will move the Cue point.
Many modern turntables have a *Line/Phono* select switch.  If yours does make sure it matches the input or switch setting on your sound card.
**Setup 2 CDJ**
2-4 timecode CDs 2-4 CD decks and 2-4 stereo sound inputs.
Setting up CDJs for use with timecode CDs is similar to setting up turntables. The figure below outlines a typical configuration. First connect the RCA cables of the CDJs to inputs of your sound card. Second connect the inputs of your mixer to the outputs of your sound card. Make sure the input mode of your sound card is set to *Line*.
Using Mixxx together with CDJs and external mixer
Left or right channel is missing. Mixxx receives only a mono signal but needs a stereo timecode signal to operate.
Check the wiring on your turntable / CDJ and also the headshell and needle on your turntable.
|tooloud|
Timecode signal too loud. Mixxx receives a signal which has too much amplification.
Lower the amplification either on your external Mixer soundcard or with the `Turntable Input Preamp`

Lock user fields
You can lock user data fields. This is useful for sites where the user data is maintained by the administrators manually by editing user records or uploading using the 'Upload users' facility. If you are locking fields that are required by Moodle make sure that you provide that data when creating user accounts or the accounts will be unusable.Consider setting the lock mode to 'Unlocked if empty' to avoid this problem.

Why you might want to set the block instance title?
There can be multiple instances of the Completion Progress block. You may use different Completion Progress blocks to monitor different sets of activities or resources. For instance you could track progress in assignments in one block and quizzes in another. For this reason you can override the default title and set a more appropriate block title for each instance.
Why show a progress percentage to students?
It is possible to show an overall percentage of progress to students.This is calculated as the number of activities completed divided by the total number of activities in the bar.The progress percentage appears until the student mouses over an item in the bar.
Why you might want to use icons?
If there are multiple courses with different parent categories but with the same parent category name the parent category filter will be filled with multiple categories with the same name by default. This can be confusing to the user. If you want to merge all homonymous parent categories into one filter entry when using the parent category filter activate this settingThis setting is only processed when the parent category filter is activated

How do we use financial support?
fund developers to work on specific aspects of QGIS including implementing new features and fixing bugs
Decisions on spending of sponsorship funds will be made by the QGIS Project Steering Committee.
We regret that we cannot accept 'earmarked' funding as it creates many administrative issues. If you are interested in funding specific aspects of QGIS development we encourage you to allocate additional human resources to the project e.g. hiring a developer or participating to our bug fixing initiative.

The game ratio is the ratio between image width and image height. Use AUTO to let the emulator choose the original game ratio that will give you the best retrogaming experience.
Smooth the game image. This option makes the image smoother using bilinear filtering.
This option allows you to rewind the game if you get killed by a monster or if you make any other mistake. Use the HOTKEY + LEFT command within the game to rewind.
Auto save the state when you quit a game and auto load last saved state when you start a game.
Integer scaling is scaling by a factor of a whole number such as 2x 3x 4x etc. This option scales the image up to the greatest integer scale below the set resolution. So for instance if you set your fullscreen resolution to 1920x1080 and enable integer scaling it will only scale a 320x240 image up to 1280x960 and leave black borders all around. This is to maintain a 11 pixel ratio with the original source image so that pixels are not unevenly duplicated.

The data will be returned in the format requested for requests (e.g. json) with the response data for each ref located under a ref# structure (e.g. ref0 = /direct/entity1/123 ref1 = /direct/entity2/456). The headers status ref entityURL and data (or raw content) will be returned for each ref. If the data from the ref can be understood as the requested format it will be integrated into the response if not it will be included as raw content.
Input is specially handled for batch requests. Input should be in the form of http params (in the header) with the batch key prefixed to every param that is unique for the related batch request and any shared params left without a prefix. For example we want to batch create 2 poll options and they share the same pollId. The params sent might like so (pollId=111 ref0.text='Ice cream and kittens' ref1.text='I hate nice things') The pollId will be applied to both poll options being created. Sending encoded data in the request body is not currently supported.

Planet classification from host star spectral type (F G K M) habitable zone (hot warm cold) and size (miniterran subterran terran superterran jovian neptunian) (Earth = G-Warm Terran).
Equilibrium Temperature
The planetary equilibrium temperature is a theoretical temperature in (°C) that the planet would be at when considered simply as if it were a black body being heated only by its parent star (assuming a 0.3 bond albedo). As example the planetary equilibrium temperature of Earth is -18.15°C (255 K).
Earth Similarity Index (ESI)
Similarity to Earth on a scale from 0 to 1 with 1 being the most Earth-like. ESI depends on the planet's radius density escape velocity and surface temperature.

This could mean that you’re on a network that’s censored.
* Français (fr)
In the case of banks and other sensitive websites it is also common to see geography-based blocking (if a bank knows you generally access their services from one country and suddenly you are connecting from an exit relay on the other side of the world your account may be locked or suspended).
Since Disconnect is more of a meta search engine which allows users to choose between different search providers it fell back to delivering Bing search results which were basically unacceptable quality-wise.
## If you control multiple relays include then in the family
Set your security to "Standard".
The default location on Windows is the Desktop; on macOS it is the Applications folder (on macOS you have to move it into the Applications folder when you complete the installation process).
Can I use the Tor logo in my product?
For more information about bridges see the Tor Browser manual.
We don’t think Flash is safe to use in any browser — it's a very insecure piece of software that can easily compromise your privacy or serve you malware.
If your issue is not listed please file a bug report about what you're experiencing.
We are so sorry but you have been infected with malware.
The best success we've had in getting sites to unblock Tor users is getting users to contact the site administrators directly.
Does Tor Browser use a different circuit for each website?
Please note that some antivirus clients like Kaspersky may also be blocking Tor at the firewall level.
Also using paths longer than 3 could harm anonymity first because it makesdenial of security attacks easier and second because it could act as an identifier if only a small number of users have the same path length as you.

This step is usually fast but it may take a few minutes.

Learn how to control personally-identifying information in Tor Browser
Managing identities
When you connect to a website it is not only the operators of that website who can record information about your visit. Most websites now use numerous third-party services including social networking “Like” buttons analytics trackers and advertising beacons all of which can link your activity across different sites.
Using the Tor network stops observers from being able to discover your exact location and IP address but even without this information they might be able to link different areas of your activity together. For this reason Tor Browser includes some additional features that help you control what information can be tied to your identity.
If you still can’t connect your Internet Service Provider might be censoring connections to the Tor network. Read the Circumvention section for possible solutions.
Tor Browser is under constant development and some issues are known about but not yet fixed. Please check the Known Issues page to see if the problem you are experiencing is already listed there.
How to remove Tor Browser from your system
Tor Browser does not affect any of the existing software or settings on your computer. Uninstalling Tor Browser will not affect your system’s software or settings.
Locate your Tor Browser folder. The default location on Windows is the Desktop; on Mac OS X it is the Applications folder. On Linux there is no default location however the folder will be named "tor-browseren-US" if you are running the English Tor Browser.

The default Ubuntu MATE user interface is intuitive and easy to use. But we understand people have different tastes and preferences which is why we created MATE Tweak a tool to change the user interface to mimic other operating systems. Coming from Windows? Try Redmond.  Prefer the way macOS is layed out? Try Cupertino.  For Ubuntu Unity fans take a look at Mutiny.  Or for a hybrid user interface try Pantheon or Comptemporary. Experienced users can customise the user interface and save their creations.

Allow only one running instance
Allowing only one running instance of VLC can sometimes be useful for example if you associated VLC with some media types and you don't want a new instance of VLC to be opened each time you open a file in your file manager. This option will allow you to play the file with the already running instance or enqueue it.

Hail Gweddry!
Greetings Owaec! We have been forced from our positions by undead invaders. They follow us even now.
I can tell by your words that you have not seen the hordes for yourself. It is like all of the dead warriors from all the ages have come back to attack us. There is no end to the columns of marching skeletons the wailing ghosts the infernal bats led by the foul necromancers who raised them.
Sire the undead armies are attacking!
Well that will have to be the end of our council. Let us fight!

Excellent. Two hours past midnight meet us on the west bank of the river across from Elensefar’s docks.
I want you to reinforce us once we break through their line.
Very well. When you raise your red banner over any building in the city proper we will see the sign and attack from the city’s northern gate.
Agreed. But will you be able to see our flag if it’s dark?
Yes we will see it. In fact we prefer to fight at night. I pray you do not lead us into slaughter.

Very well! Explain your presence here then human. Who are you? Why have you risked life and limb to come to Knalga home of the dwarves?
You would do well to learn the lesson he did not.
Indeed
I became my mother’s most trusted aide-de-camp. I was sent to quiet the worst of the rebellion. Of course they fought back. I never knew who these people were or why they fought my mother. Konrad you are lucky. You do not know what Wesnoth has been like these past many years. There is no peace. I have never known peace.
I do know the cup of bitterness poured out on Wesnoth by your mother child. The land has been torn apart. The elves know this. The orcs know this. Undead can feel it. Large armies of men march across the plains hunting each other and when no men remain outsiders will claim Wesnoth as their home.
Enough! I can listen to no more of this. Princess you may want to end your mother’s rule but I will end her life as she ended the life of my father and my brothers. Asheviere’s masterwork of treachery will end and it will end by my blade!
No dragon has been sighted in those mountains for many years but they retain their name of old. Still that path will be dangerous for us. Is there not another route we might take?
All routes are dangerous though there is some hope along this path. Rest and then go forth friends. Fortune has smiled upon you so far despite great dangers. Perhaps she will continue to do so.
Yes rest. Your soldiers will be tended to and refreshed. We have made sure you will leave our protection with the resources to finish your journey.

Your pursuits?
The former King’s magic ministry kept a tight control on the training and employment of mages in Wesnoth. Those of us who dared to depart from the curriculum you might say were dealt with harshly. We are outcasts because we seek to master shadow magic. Our secrecy and security are not cheap.
I have heard of you. Necromancers. Barely-human scum I say.
Wrong. Necromancers become slaves to their lich masters and eventually lose their humanity. We have proven that practicing the dark arts need not lead down that path to damnation. We remain human and seek the mystical secret of balance between the ways of light and darkness. We dance between both ways adhering to neither.
We don’t. You have sought us out. But I do know of your situation and am willing to help. Any weakening of the Throne of Wesnoth whether it be occupied by King or Queen aids us.

Rogue Mage
Some mages are thrown out of the mage’s guild for attempting to practice forbidden arts. Now completely outside the law these rogue mages do whatever necessary to support their study of black magic. Although not as skilled as mages with more formal training their magic can be quite lethal while their banditry has resulted in moderate skill with the short sword.

The Jeweler
So you have returned. I assume you have obtained the required materials? My jeweler Theganli has spent the last two years buying jewels from some of the northern clans. So now go to the forge and make your sceptre. What do you need to annoy me for?
We don’t. Not everything is about you. We need to talk to Theganli.
That makes sense I guess you would want to plan the sceptre’s design what in particular do you want him to do?
I need to make the plans for the sceptre then have him cut the ruby to match them.

No. Why? You fools you gave the Ruby of Fire to the elves. But that won’t save you from me. I will destroy you then I will deal with the elves.

The magic of the elves is wholly unlike that of humanity so much so that humans are almost universally incapable of understanding it let alone using it. Likewise those who are masters of it are equally enigmatic; though it can be said that they are revered by their people very little can be said about their actual function or purpose within that society.

Tales are told of the mightiest warriors and generals who cursed with hate and stung by betrayal have come back to this world as Death Knights. Wielding the same weapons as in life they command the Undead in their quest for revenge.
Deathblade
In life the abominations known as ‘Deathblades’ were masters of combat soldiers who were both lithe and deadly. Their new masters recognizing this outfit them to match the skills they once had. Though frail these monsters are much faster than the rest of their kind both on foot and with their blades.
Draug
There is little left in these towering ruins of the men they once were. Warriors at heart they are now lost in the dream of unlife; wandering through the battles of their memory and fighting desperately for release for a peace bought only by strength of arms. And so they struggle; both unthinking and unrelenting.
I agree we should not forget our dead. We should build a huge pyre and burn them with proper ceremony so that the smoke may carry them on to the next realm.
And so it was done. The dead were laid reverently on top of what little wood we could find. But the fire was big enough to burn the bodies to ashes and speed their souls to the hereafter. I remember at the time that the death of so many of our people was not the best omen for the start of such a large journey. They were the first of our people to die in this great endeavor but they were to be far from the last.
Across the Harsh Sands
Pinnacle Rock
Do you remember anything about these sands?
Where is Garak? Has anybody seen him?
I saw him jumping into deep darkness pursuing a group of enemies. Let’s hope nothing happened to him.
Look dawn is nigh our salvation is almost at hand. Even the long dark can’t last forever and with the light of the sun the undead power wanes and their dark magics unravel.
No! This contest is not over yet Azkotep. I shall show you a taste of my true power.

In the Tunnels of the Trolls
Troll Interrogator
Troll Assistant
So you’ve come at last. Let it end here and now!
The chieftain has fallen! Flee for your lives!
Little elves fight good. Zurg impressed. With dwarf chieftain dead cowardly dwarves flee before us. Our struggle not over still much more fighting but elf and troll have won this battle. We thank you. Great Leader has allowed you to come speak with him. Great honor never has one of your kind been allowed in his presence. But he wishes to talk with you and reward you. Please come with me.
With their knowledge of all these secret tunnels you’d think they could have led us straight here instead of making us go through those ‘light defenses’. It would have saved us a lot of unnecessary fighting in actually getting to the dwarf chieftain.
Perhaps they wanted to further test our prowess in battle. And besides every dwarf we kill is one they don’t have to. Still I think we caused a bigger distraction than they were expecting.
Good that should be the entrance to the secret tunnel. Now just push hard inwards.
Hold on I think I’ve found it.
The passage just halts at a dead end.
You didn’t expect the other end to be left wide open did you? There should be another secret door hidden right in front of you.
Oh right. Hold on I think I’ve found it.
We’re still trying to get a head count but between the underground horrors and the water we lost quite a few. Recruiting new warriors is going to be even more difficult. Still we should thank Eloh and you Kaleh that so many of us did survive.
Well Nym’s right we don’t know what’s out there. So we should set up a perimeter guard around the cave mouth and start discovering what this side of the mountains looks like.
Look the tunnel slopes sharply downwards to the left. And it’s big enough that it should divert most of the rising water.
And I think I see a faint light off to the right.
But truly I cannot return the way I came and even if there are other tunnels which lead back down to my homeland I do not know where to search for them. I know as little about the land above ground as you do.
And why should we trust anything you say?
My master thought you might be suspicious. She said that what we must talk with you about concerns the fate of your people. Apparently it concerns ‘Yechnagoth’ and ‘Zhangor’. She said that you would understand Kaleh.
Thank you. Now I have a boon to ask of you. Our instructions were to find you and to bring you and your people to meet with my master. The problem is that I don’t know where she is hiding.
You don’t know where to find your master?
It would be suicide for you to try to rescue them alone. Of course we will help you.
That is why I called out to Tanstafaal one of my loyal followers. All is not yet lost. Follow him and I can still deliver you from your peril. But first come back to me stop fighting these humans and kill this heretic Kaleh and his cronies.
She claims to be the one who has shepherded us during his journey but who protected you across the harsh sands who fought the orcs and led you under the mountains who led you out again against all odds? I did. I have bled for you every step of the way. If you will not trust me based on my words then trust me based on my actions. I have done the best I could for my people and I stand by my actions. I believe that the merfolk are our friends as the dwarves were. I refuse to bow down to harsh words and threats; we elves have always been free to make our own choices. We are not slaves and will not blindly follow either humans or some false god.

Your words are meaningless Kaleh. My brethren Eloh has appeared to you. She has spoken. Defy her at your own peril. I declare all who oppose Eloh heretics. All who are faithful join me and let us kill the usurpers!
Eloh would never ask elf to kill elf. But it seems I have little choice. My people I have led you this far join with me and help me crush this new rebellion!
Whether this was all planned or not what’s important is what should we do with ourselves now? We have a duty to protect our people.
No no no! Too much blood has been spilled. This has gone on way too far for us to just end it now and walk away. You saw what she did to Keratur and Tanstafaal their blood is on my hands and I will have vengeance!
Even if we turn around and leave now where will we go?
I admit that Melusand does have a point. We cannot return under the mountains the way we came the humans will be heavily guarding that path for sure by now. We could ask the merfolk to return us back to the coasts to the north or south of where we came but I do not know these lands at all. We would be wandering aimlessly through the wilderness. Oh if only we did have Eloh to guide us. We need her now more than ever.
I know! I know! Would you like me to kill myself as punishment or step down as leader? Imagine how I feel. I heard her voice it was just as you had told us since we were children Zhul. The voice of our god speaking to us for the first time since the olden days. And I believed I wanted to believe so badly that I could take our people away from the horror and the death. I see them now whenever I sleep I see their faces all of our brethren who have died on the accursed journey. Oh I wish none of this had ever happened!

refreshed
Chapter 2 When I was fifteen I went on my first raid against an orcish incursion to the west. A large band of orcs under some new banner had come out of the northern foothills and were rampaging across the sands killing anything they could get their filthy hands on.
I was giddy on the journey back home my heart pumping with elation and pride. I had fought my first battle; now I was a man like my father. Then one night during the long dark a harsh wind came up moaning and howling around our tents. By dawn it had only gotten worse; I wondered if some dark god was trying to avenge the massacre of the orcs. I’d seen sandstorms before but I had never experienced one like this. I hid in my tent praying to Eloh as if my life depended on it. The air grew thick with sand and everything grew dark and hazy
The next thing I remember someone was bending over me shaking me awake. I was half buried in sand and I felt weak but alive. Our equipment was scattered across the dunes or buried in the sand. Looking around I only saw a few of my companions who were digging in the sand fervently hoping to find other survivors. I dug furiously at the sand with my bare hands and yelled until I was hoarse but try as I might I could not find my father. They told me he had been swallowed by the sand but I would not be consoled. In one instant my world crumbled; I never looked at the sands quite the same way again. I learned that day that the desert can be fickle and fierce and death is always lurking just over the horizon.
Now I journeyed out again across the sands but this time it was not just myself but my entire people that I had to protect. They were depending on my judgment and I was only too aware of the weight on my narrow shoulders. Thinking of the last time we had gone out in force I made a silent prayer to my father to watch over us. There was nowhere to go but north.

Second Briefing
An Ancient Castle
By the Gods! One of our scouts has discovered a mighty castle at the center of the old plateau. The castle must be quite old and seems to have been built in a foreign style. It’s quite obvious that this is not barbarian craft.
Let’s hope that Lanissa – the warlord holding sway over that castle – has not discovered our movements yet. Perhaps we have a chance of conquering that mighty building without a bigger fight! However it is essential that we capture it. It will be the key to our reign over this island!

Today I saw the first recruits gathering in front of the new barracks. If everything goes well they should receive their training soon.
Jundlina Summons Sidolus
Jundlina is Angry
What is this I hear Sidolus? I received words about your soldiers misbehaving and bullying the common folk. What is this nonsense all about? They are servants for the common good and must not misuse their powers. This is inexcusable! Explain this if you will!
Sidolus Seems Contrite
Thron is shaking his head
Yet the war goes on. More and more of our brothers and sisters flee the brutal war raging in the capital beneath the trees.
The stories they tell about the deeds of our kin are sad to hear. I’ve spent nights lying awake restless more tired than I ever believed one could be. Yet whenever I close my eyes I see the fortress my father built consumed by flames. The Throne Among the Trees the symbol of unity and peace among our kin became the wedge that drives us apart.
Today my hunters brought men women and little children before me who had hidden out in the forests trying to escape the war hate and revenge that rage among the tribes fighting each other like in olden times when we were no more but wild beasts driven and controlled by instincts. None of my brothers will ever gain and hold control over the wooden throne none of the tribes will be strong enough to subdue the other. There will be no end to this slaughter unless is this it? As father told me?
To rise against whoever threatens our very existence even though it may be one of your own blood or mind?
We have found a village with friendly and productive people impressed by our wealth technology and strength.
They have lived simply yet blithely from hunting and farming. They have not been involved in any conflict so far and are not ready for fighting.
But they fear that the war around Al’thunran will set an end to this life. Therefore they have decided to join us hoping that we can help each other.

Dangerous Ship Parts
Saledus looks unhappy
Sire I don’t want to start a panic but I found something which gives me a sinking feeling in my stomach and spreads waves of fear in my heart. As I walked down to the southern shore I found the remains of another ship. I don’t know whether these parts are all that is left of that ship. In any case these parts do not seem to be old.
Perhaps the people aboard that ship were caught in the same storm which brought us to Malac’ Mor – and were brought to this island.
I beg you to be cautious and to build some blockhouses or sentries around our colony.
Rocks Nothing but Rocks
Sire I saw that the construction of the outpost was completed so I have assigned some of my best soldiers to it to keep the watch.
But although this is a good step forward I can’t see much space for buildings. The whole island is littered with rocks. How can we ever build a new ship or even have some basic infrastructure to make our lives more comfortable?
Amalea’s Plan
Lutius this may seem very tricky but we can do it. First of all we need patience as well as speed and a plan to succeed in this part of the world.
Training Infrastructure is Needed
Saledus has security concerns
Sire we need to train some of our people to serve in your great army. It is important to increase the number of our soldiers as fast as we can. And we should train them well to improve their fighting abilities.
Therefore we need to build a full training infrastructure despite the limited space available. We need some barracks a training camp and an arena or a colosseum.
Time to get Home Again
First of all we need more construction materials. So we should build at least three lumberjacks’ houses and two quarries.
Oh before I forget there is another task to accomplish. While our builders are doing their job somebody should clear up our road network. They are leaving us no space to place the buildings that we need.
Amalea is Somewhat Relieved
Amalea is giving a deep sigh
Praise the gods Lutius! We have found the plans on how to build and operate farms.
We Should Expel The Barbarians
Now that we have some fully trained soldiers it is time to expel the Barbarians from our homeland.
Let’s finish them off and regain control over our lands. They shall regret deeply that they ever came!
Saledus is cheering loudly
Sire finally we have defeated the Barbarians. We have expelled even the last of them. May they never come back!
The bakery and brewery should be enhanced as soon as the workers have enough experience. They can then produce mead and bread sweetened with honey. Build a beekeeper’s house next to the berry farm to produce some honey which we can store until we need it.
Build a Mining Economy
Mining economy
We can now produce all the kinds of food that we are used to. I wonder what treasures these hills might contain? We should find out.
Build an iron mine and perhaps a gold mine. As they produce only ores we will need a furnace to smelt them. Also build a blacksmithy to ensure we won’t run out of tools – and yes a small armor smithy as well. It produces helmets as well as swords. I hope we won’t meet enemies here but it’s better to be prepared.
Expand and conquer
We have built a home in this wonderful landscape. But as our tribe grows we need more space. We should start expanding our territory.
The scouts reported that the lands to the north are rugged hills beautiful to behold but not suited for buildings. Let’s find out what we can discover in the south.
Metal Shortage
We are out of metals
The shorter your road segments are the faster your wares will be transported. You should therefore make sure that your roads have as many flags as possible.
Build a blue flag now in the middle of the road that connects your headquarters to your lumberjack’s hut.

Well done! Let’s wait till the hut is finished.

Archive Your Inbox Messages
The message window is central to fully controlling your tribe’s fortune. However you will get a lot of messages in a real game. To keep your head straight you should try to keep the inbox empty.
Archive all your messages in your inbox now.
To do so open the message window by pressing ‘n’ or clicking the second button from the right at the very bottom of the screen. The newest message will be marked for you automatically. Keep clicking the ‘Archive selected message’ button until all messages have been archived and the list is empty.
Well done. Now you know how to draw back your soldiers from the places where you don’t need them. It is time to tell you how to reinforce your front line.
Your fortress is already quite strong and conquers a lot of space. But there is an even bigger building the citadel.
Citadels can’t be built directly. Instead you’ll have to construct a fortress first and then enhance it to a citadel. To do so click on the fortress then choose the ‘Enhance to Citadel’ button.
Your soldiers will leave the fortress while the construction is going on. This means that your fortress will lose its military influence as I described above.
Enhance your fortress to a citadel now.
Check out your taverns
At first we should find out how many taverns we currently have. Widelands offers you a window where you can easily check this.
First you will have to open the statistics menu (you can find the corresponding button at the bottom). We will need this menu several times.
Afterwards choose the ‘Building statistics’.
Open the building statistics window.
I’ll continue as soon as you click on the
third tab (‘Economy health’).
Switch to the third tab in the ware statistics menu window
The first two tabs show you the production and consumption of any ware. You can toggle them by simply clicking on them.
In this tab you can see the difference between production and consumption called ‘economy health’. You can see at one glance which one of those two is higher for the selected ware that means whether the amount increases or decreases.
Using the Watch Replay option in the main menu a previously played game will be precisely reconstructed for you to watch. Note however that even small changes in the game data files or the Widelands executable can cause a replay to become incompatible and to ‘go out of sync’. This is similar to how network games will suffer from desynchronization problems if one of the players has a different version of the game.

Broken Theme
The choice of subdirectory sites is disabled if this setup is more than a month old because of permalink problems with #8220;/blog/#8221; from the main site. This disabling will be addressed in a future version.
Welcome to the Network installation process!
Once you complete these steps your network is enabled and configured. You will have to log in again.
The next screen for Network Setup will give you individually-generated lines of code to add to your wp-config.php and .htaccess files. Make sure the settings of your FTP client make files starting with a dot visible so that you can find .htaccess; you may have to create this file if it really is not there. Make backup copies of those two files.
Choose subdomains or subdirectories; this can only be switched afterwards by reconfiguring your installation. Fill out the network details and click Install. If this does not work you may have to add a wildcard DNS record (for subdomains) or change to another setting in Permalinks (for subdirectories).

In some places commercial ATMs (not belonging to a financial institution) are installed in places like convenience stores. These ATMs add their fee directly to the amount instead of showing up as a separate transaction or in your monthly banking fees. For example you withdraw $100 and you are charged $10150 plus Interac fees. If you manually entered that $100 the amounts won't match. You should set this to whatever is the maximum such fee in your area (in units of your local currency) so the transaction will be recognised as a match.
A transaction whose best match's score is in the green zone (above or equal to the Auto-CLEAR threshold) will be CLEARed by default.
Dates will be completed so that they are within the current calendar year.

Screenshot of the sing interval exercise.
In this exercise Solfege will display one or more intervals and you should sing them. Unfortunately it is not yet possible to sing into a microphone and let Solfege decide if you sing correct so you have to decide yourself if you are correct or wrong.
The program will try to make a question where all tones are within the range the user can sing as configured in the preferences window. Sometimes it is not possible to keep the question within this range for example when the exercise is configured to create many intervals where all intervals go upwards.
Screenshot of the program.
If you are conducting a choir you have to sing the starting tones for the different voices and if you don't have a piano near by you have to use a tuning fork. If you are a male you will sing the tones for the women one octave deeper and visa versa.
Sixths are easiest identified by  inverting the interval and identifying the third. Then the following rule applies
If the third is diminished then the sixth is augmented
If the third is minor then the sixth is major
If the third is major then the sixth is minor
If the third is augmented then the sixth is diminished

A repository is a packages media; it can either be local (such as the installation CD) or a remote internet server. You can find an utility to setup repositories on the YaST control center which can also be accessed via the Configuration gt; Repositories menu item.
Install Upgrade Remove Undo tab pagesAll packages are listed together unless you have selected a status filter from the right-bottom box. The check-box next to the package name indicates whether the package is installed or not. If a more recent version of an installed package is available the version text will be highlighted in blue and an upgrade button conveniently placed next to it. It is highlighted red if the version installed is no longer being made available in any configured repository.The context menu (right click on a package) provides extra options. The Undo option can be used to revert any changes you have made. Multiple packages may be selected (using the Control key) and modified together.Use the Version list over the description box to select a specific version of a package.Press the Apply button when you want your changes to be performed.
Lock softwarePackages can be locked against automatic changes via the context menu.Locking is only useful in very unusual cases for instance you may not want to install a given driver because it interferes with your system yet you want to install some collection that includes it. Locks can be applied whether the package is installed or not.
SearchEnter free text into the search-field to match their names and descriptions. (a search for 'office' will bring up the 'LibreOffice' packages as well as 'AbiWord' which carries the word 'office' in its description). You can search for multiple keywords by separating the with a white space (e.g. 'spread sheet' would return 'libreoffice-calc').You may use the search combined with a filter like searching for a package in a given repository. Other search attributes are provided such as to search for a given file.
GroupsSoftware for product; is indexed so that you can find software for a specific task when you are not aware of the software selection available. A more detailed hierarchical classification is provided by the RPM Groups filter.

Package Groups shows packages by category. You can expand and collapse tree items to refine or generalize categories. Click any category to display the packages in that category in the package list on the right side.
Hint There is a "zzz All" entry at the very end of the list that will show all packages. This may take a few seconds on slow machines.
Search allows you to search for packages that meet various criteria. This is usually the easiest way to find a package if you know its name.
Hint You can also use this to find out what package contains a certain library.  Search in the Provides RPM field.
Installation Summary by default shows the changes to your system -- what packages will be installed deleted or updated.

Offline Authentication enables the user to log in even if there is no connection to the domain controller. For this option to work you must log in to your domain at least once. The user's credentials are then stored encrypted on your computer and are reused for a domain login when no connection to the domain controller can be established. This is especially useful for mobile users.
Click Expert Settings to enable advanced features such as WINS options or mounting server home directories from Active Directory domains.

Undulating throbbing star-like patterns pulsate rotate and turn inside out. Another display mode uses these shapes to lay down a field of colors which are then cycled. The motion is very organic. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
Clouds of iterated function systems spin and collide. Note that the "Detail" parameter is exponential. Number of points drawn is functions^detail. https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteratedfunctionsystem Written by Chris Le Sueur and Robby Griffin.
m6502
Emulates a 6502 microprocessor and runs some example programs on it. The family of 6502 chips were used throughout the 70's and 80's in machines such as the Atari 2600 Commodore PET VIC20 and C64 Apple ][ and the NES. Some example programs are included and it can also read in an assembly file as input. Original JavaScript Version by Stian Soreng http//www.6502asm.com/. Ported to XScreenSaver by Jeremy English. Written by Stian Soreng and Jeremy English.
Halo
Apple2
An Apple ][+ computer simulation in all its 1979 glory. It also reproduces the appearance of display on a color television set of the period. In "Basic Programming Mode" a simulated user types in a BASIC program and runs it. In "Text Mode" it displays the output of a program or the contents of a file or URL. In "Slideshow Mode" it chooses random images and displays them within the limitations of the Apple ][ display hardware. (Six available colors in hi-res mode!) On MacOS and Linux this program is also a fully-functional VT100 emulator! Run it as an application instead of as a screen saver and you can use it as a terminal. https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleIIseries Written by Trevor Blackwell and Jamie Zawinski.
Polytopes
The six regular 4D polytopes rotating in 4D. Inspired by H.S.M Coxeter's book "Regular Polytopes" 3rd Edition Dover Publications Inc. 1973 and Thomas Banchoff's book "Beyond the Third Dimension Geometry Computer Graphics and Higher Dimensions" Scientific American Library 1990. https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularpolytope Written by Carsten Steger.
Klein
Repeatedly rotates a bitmap by 90 degrees by using logical operations the bitmap is divided into quadrants and the quadrants are shifted clockwise. Then the same thing is done again with progressively smaller quadrants except that all sub-quadrants of a given size are rotated in parallel. As you watch it the image appears to dissolve into static and then reconstitute itself but rotated. Written by Jamie Zawinski.

A 4D embedding of the real projective plane. You can walk on the surface of the real projective plane or rotate it in 4D or walk on it while it rotates in 4D. Inspired by Thomas Banchoff's book "Beyond the Third Dimension Geometry Computer Graphics and Higher Dimensions" Scientific American Library 1990. https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realprojectiveplane https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romansurface https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosscap https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moebiusstrip http//mathworld.wolfram.com/RealProjectivePlane.html http//mathworld.wolfram.com/RomanSurface.html http//mathworld.wolfram.com/Cross-Cap.html http//mathworld.wolfram.com/MoebiusStrip.html Written by Carsten Steger.
The Julia set is a close relative of the Mandelbrot set. The small moving dot indicates the control point from which the rest of the image was generated. See also the "Discrete" screen saver. https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliaset Written by Sean McCullough.
