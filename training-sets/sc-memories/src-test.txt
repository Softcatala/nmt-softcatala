Set conversion options specific to each output format
Adding books
Control how calibre reads metadata from files when adding books
Saving books to disk
Control how calibre exports files from its database to disk when using Save to disk
Path to the cover to use for the added book
A comma separated list of languages (best to use ISO639 language codes though some language names may also be recognized)
ADDING FROM DIRECTORIES
Options to control the adding of books from directories. By default only files that have extensions of known e-book file types are added.
Assume that each directory has only a single logical book and that all files in it are different e-book formats of that book
Virtual library search is recursive {}
Recursive query group detected {0}
Run Python code.
Run the Python code in file.
Subset the specified font. Use -- after this option to pass option to the font subsetting program.
Show Recommendations
Kobo now shows recommendations on the device. In some cases these have files but in other cases they are just pointers to the web site to buy. Enable if you wish to see/delete them.
Attempt to support newer firmware
Kobo routinely updates the firmware and the database version. With this option calibre will attempt to perform full read-write functionality - Here be Dragons!! Enable only if you are comfortable with restoring your kobo to factory defaults and testing software
Getting list of books on device
Set this option to have separate book covers uploaded every time you connect your device. Unset this option if you have so many books on the reader that performance is unacceptable.
Preserve cover aspect ratio when building thumbnails
Set this option if you want the cover thumbnails to have the same aspect ratio (width to height) as the cover. Unset it if you want the thumbnail to be the maximum size ignoring aspect ratio.
Search for books in all folders
Setting this option tells calibre to look for books in all folders on the device and its cards. This permits calibre to find books put on the device by other software and by wireless download.
Apply no processing to the image
Do not convert the image to grayscale (black and white)
Specify the image size as widthxheight pixels. Normally an image size is automatically calculated from the output profile this option overrides it.
When converting a CBC do not add links to each page to the TOC. Note this only applies if the TOC has more than one section
Convert DOCX files (.docx and .docm) to HTML
Normally extra spaces are condensed into a single space. With this option all spaces will be displayed.
Normally extra space at the beginning of lines is retained. With this option they will be removed.
Force splitting on the max-line-length value when no space is present. Also allows max-line-length to be below the minimum
Do not remove links within the document. This is only useful when paired with a txt-output-formatting option that is not none because links are always removed with plain text output.
Do not remove image references within the document. This is only useful when paired with a txt-output-formatting option that is not none because links are always removed with plain text output.

calibre helps you find the e-books you want by searching the websites of various commercial and public domain book sources for you.
Using the integrated search you can easily find which store has the book you are looking for at the best price. You also get DRM status and other useful information.
All transactions (paid or otherwise) are handled between you and the book seller. calibre is not part of this process and any issues related to a purchase should be directed to the website you are buying from. Be sure to double check that any books you get will work with your e-book reader especially if the book you are buying has DRM.

Typesetting Math in e-books
The calibre E-book viewer has the ability to display math embedded in e-books (EPUB and HTML files). You can typeset the math directly with TeX or MathML or AsciiMath. The calibre E-book viewer uses the excellent `MathJax ` library to do this. This is a brief tutorial on creating e-books with math in them that work well with the calibre E-book viewer.

If you want to utilize multi-threading enter the size you want your sub jobs to be split into. Recommended values are between 1000 and 10000. Use a lower value if your server has multiple cron jobs running simultaneously but do not use values smaller than 1000. Enter "0" to disable multi-threading and process mail as one single job - batch limits still apply.

Organizing Your Data
CiviCRM comes with 3 basic (built-in) contact types Individual Household and Organization. You can create additional contact types based on these basic types to further differentiate contacts (for example you might create Student Parent Staff and /or Volunteer "subtypes" from the basic Individual type). You can also re-name the built-in types. Contact subtypes are especially useful when you need to collect and display different sets of custom data for different types of contacts.
Contact Type Icon
Relative URL for a default Drupal site
"Counted?" controls whether a person with that status is counted as participant for the purpose of controlling the Maximum Number of Participants.
By default CiviCRM uses the primary email address of the logged in user as the FROM address when sending emails to contacts. However you can use this page to define one or more general Email Addresses that can be selected as an alternative. EXAMPLE "Client Services" lt;clientservices@example.orggt;

The CiviCRM module stores information on the universe of people associated with a community and on their interactions such as emails donations petitions events etc. It can act as a stand alone contact management system or it can be integrated with mass mailer volunteer management petition and event finding. CiviCRM enables organizations to maintain all these activities in a single database creating efficiencies and new opportunities for communities to better communicate and benefit from relationships with their community members.
The CiviCRM module allows you to create contacts or import them from other sources. You can record relationships between contacts such as indicating they live in the same household. There are two types of groups of contacts. You can create static groups which have a set list of contacts. You can also create dynamic (smart) groups based on characteristics that contacts have in common. For example you could create a group of all contacts who live in California AND who have volunteered for your organization within the past year. The CiviCRM module also allows for tagging for less formal categorization of contacts or groups. You can easily extend CiviCRM to record community member information which is specific to your community or organization using custom fields. For example you can create a set of fields to track volunteer skills and preferences. CiviCRM profile gives you a way to allow community members ('users') to update their own information as well as share some of that information with others. Finally you can configure custom activity types such as volunteering or attending events.

First you have to specify where the translator input files (I.E. the files used by translators to do their job) are located. It can be done by such a line
The command is thus B. The first argument is the path to the POT file to use. All subsequent arguments are of the self-explanatory form
If you've defined the template languages you can rewrite the line above this way
[po4apaths] doc/l10n/project.doc.pot $langdoc/l10n/$lang.po
[po4apaths] doc/$master/$master.pot $langdoc/$master/$lang.po

How to use po4a?
Graphical overview
The translators can still use the context to translate since the strings in the PO file are in the same order than in the original document. Translating sequentially is thus rather comparable whether you use po4a or not.  And in any case the best way to get the context remains to convert the document to a printable format since the text formatting ones are not really readable IMHO.
This approach is the one used by professional translators. I agree that they have somewhat different goals than open-source translators. The maintenance is for example often less critical to them since the content changes rarely.
Why not to split on sentence level (or smaller)?
Professional translator tools sometimes split the document at the sentence level in order to maximize the reusability of previous translations and speed up their process.  The problem is that the same sentence may have several translations depending on the context.
Paragraphs are by definition longer than sentences. It will hopefully ensure that having the same paragraph in two documents will have the same meaning (and translation) regardless of the context in each case.
equivalent to \fRtext\fP
CWEtextE -- constant width text
equivalent to \f(CWtext\fP or ".CW text"
Remark The CW face is not available for all groff devices. It is not recommended to use it. It is provided for your convenience.
Putting 'E' and 'E' in translations
I agree this needs some more documentation but it is still considered as beta and I hate to document stuff which may/will change.
Warning support for DTDs is quite experimental. I did not read any reference manual to find the definition of every tag. I did add tag definition to the module 'till it works for some documents I found on the net. If your document use more tags than mine it won't work. But as I said above fixing that should be quite easy.
I did test DocBook against the SAG (System Administrator Guide) only but this document is quite big and should use most of the DocBook specificities.
For DebianDoc I tested some of the manuals from the DDP but not all yet.
In case of file inclusion string reference of messages in PO files (i.e. lines like C) will be wrong.
Manipulating document files
Add another input document at the end of the existing one. The argument is the filename to read.
Please note that it does not parse anything. You should use the parse()  function when you're done with packing input files into the document.
Write the translated document to the given filename.
Manipulating PO files
WORKING WITH ATTRIBUTES
treatattributes(@)
This function handles the translation of the tags' attributes. It receives the tag without the beginning / end marks and then it finds the attributes and it translates the translatable ones (specified by the module option "attributes").  This returns a plain string with the translated tag.

Fedora Cloud images are preconfigured filesystem images with very few packages installed by default. They include special tools for interacting with cloud platforms and are not intended to be used outside of cloud environments.
Fedora Cloud comes in several varieties. The Fedora Cloud Base image is a minimal base for cloud deployments. The Fedora Cloud Atomic image is a Docker container host that uses Project Atomic technology for updates. A Docker base image for Fedora is also available.
Cloud images are preconfigured and do not require installation as described in this guide. Get started using Fedora Cloud at 
The tiny images at  are written to CDs USB drives or even floppy disks. The BFO image loads installation media from Fedora's servers and directly loads an installation environment like the netinstall ISO.

Fedora images are Hybrid ISOs and can be used to create installation media with both optical and USB disks for booting on both BIOS and UEFI systems.
Note on Universal USB Creators
Universal USB creation tools such as Unetbootin are a historically popular way to create USB installers from ISOs intended for optical media. They typically function by creating a filesystem on the USB drive extracting files from the image and writing syslinux bootloader to the device.
Apache Hive
The Apache Hive data warehouse software facilitates querying and managing large data sets residing in distributed storage. Hive provides a mechanism to project structure onto this data and query the data using a SQL-like language called HiveQL. At the same time this language also allows traditional map/reduce programmers to plug in their custom mappers and reducers when it is inconvenient or inefficient to express this logic in HiveQL.
MariaDB 10.0
In Fedora 21 MariaDB have been updated to the upstream version 10.0 which provides various bug fixes and enhancements. Among others the support for parallel and multi-source replication has been added as well as the support for global transaction IDs. In addition several new storage engines have been implemented.
For the list of all changes visit the MariaDB Knowledge Base at .

Important changes for gPodder 2 users
gPodder now stores all data and downloads in the /gPodder directory instead of downloads in /gpodder-downloads and configuration data in hidden folders.
gPodder has changed configuration and date storage mechanisms. Before launching gPodder migrating users should run /usr/bin/gpodder-migrate2tres.
If you have run gPodder before running the migration utility remove the new /gPodder and run /usr/bin/gpodder-migrate2tres again.

I'm an Indonesian born in Indonesia but have lived in many different places -- Singapore UK USA. I'm now doing my doctorate at a university in Germany.
What are you studying?
Linux users can video chat with each other (on desktop Linux as well as on mobile devices such as the Maemo-based Nokia N-series). but interoperability with Windows/Mac Google Talk users is a bit problematic. Pidgin used to crash when a GTalk user initiated the video call with 32-bit Linux no problem. With 64-bit Fedora the instructions for getting Flash working is I'm afraid a bit more complicated. We document the process quite well - and I believe Firefox will redirect users to the Adobe site where they can download Flash but alas it's not as automated as on Windows/Mac (the Flash download site can be quite cryptic if you don't know what RPM and Deb files are.)

Atomic Host is built every 2 weeks or so.
Please test before using new versions in production. If you do discover a problem the Atomic Host tools make it easy to flip back to an earlier release ‚Äî and if that happens please also help us by filing bugs or submitting fixes.
Fedora Atomic Host images are updated roughly every two weeks rather than on the main six-month Fedora cadence. Because development is moving quickly only the latest major Fedora release is supported.

This chapter describes the security benefits of using OpenSSH; and shows SSH encryption in action compared to telnet.
Benefits
The primary benefit of using OpenSSH is security. SSH provides encryption when remotely connecting to and configuring a host and allows the same functionality as the older less secure tools and adds more features over them.

You can use the live image to try different desktop environments such as GNOME KDE Xfce or others. None of these choices require you to reconfigure an existing Linux installation on your computer. You can learn more about the various desktop environments in the Fedoranbsp;PRODVER; User Guide available from .
Live images on USB can include both a persistence overlay and a separate area for user data. The persistence overlay allows you to make changes to the Fedora Live environment and retain these changes for the next time that you use the Fedora Live image. These changes can include system software updates configuration changes and new programs you choose to install. The separate user data area allows you to reinstall the live image with a newer version of Fedora later while retaining your documents media files and other important information.
Disadvantages of a Live Image
While using this live image on DVD your computer might be much slower to respond or require more time to complete tasks than with a system installed to hard disk. DVD discs provide data to the computer at a much slower rate than hard disks do. Less of your computer's system memory is available for loading and running applications. Running the live image from RAM trades higher memory usage for faster response times.
Due to space constraints fewer programs are included than in a full installation of Fedora. Your favorite applications may not be present in this live image even though they may be present and run quite well in a full installation of Fedora.

The cleartext password is read from standard input or entered interactively.  The obfuscated password is put into ldapdefaultauthtok parameter of a given SSSD domain and the ldapdefaultauthtoktype parameter is set to obfuscatedpassword. Refer to  sssd-ldap 5  for more details on these parameters.
Please note that obfuscating the password provides no real security benefit as it is still possible for an attacker to reverse-engineer the password back. Using better authentication mechanisms such as client side certificates or GSSAPI is strongly advised.
-s--stdin
The password to obfuscate will be read from standard input.
-d--domain DOMAIN
-U--users
Invalidate all user records. This option overrides invalidation of specific user if it was also set.
-g--group group
Invalidate specific group.
-G--groups
-h--help
SSSD supports two representations for specifying the debug level. The simplest is to specify a decimal value from 0-9 which represents enabling that level and all lower-level debug messages. The more comprehensive option is to specify a hexadecimal bitmask to enable or disable specific levels (such as if you wish to suppress a level).
Currently supported debug levels
0 0x0010 Fatal failures. Anything that would prevent SSSD from starting up or causes it to cease running.
2 0x0040 Serious failures. An error announcing that a particular request or operation has failed.

The basic tools in GIMP 2 are not very different from their predecessors in GIMP 1. The Select Regions by Color tool is now shown in the GIMP toolbox but was already included in GIMP 1 as a menu option in the Select menu. The Transform tool has been divided into several specialized tools Rotation Scale Shearing and Perspective. Color operations are now associated with layers in the menu LayerColors but this is merely a cleanup they were already present in the Image menu (illogically since they are layer operations). Thus no completely new tools appear in this release but two of the tools have been totally revamped compared to the older versions the Text tool and the Path tool. More on this below.
The user interface for tools has also changed significantly. The Tool Options dialog box was modified to not resize itself when a new tool is chosen. Most users felt that the window changing size when a new tool was selected was annoying. Now by default the Tool Options dialog is constantly open and docked under the toolbox where it can easily be found.
The Tool Options for many tools have new possibilities that weren't available in GIMP 1. Without being exhaustive here are the most noticeable improvements.
All selection tools now have mode buttons Replace Add Subtract and Intersect. In GIMP 1 the only way to change the selection mode was to use the Ctrl or Shift buttons which could get very confusing because those buttons also had other functions. For example pressing and holding the Shift key while using the Rectangle selection tool forces the rectangle to be a square. Thus to add a square selection you would first press Shift then click the mouse then release Shift then press Shift again then sweep out the selection with the mouse then release Shift. It can now be done more easily.
For transformation tools buttons now control which object (layer selection or path) is affected by the transformation. You can for example transform a rectangular selection to various quadrilateral shapes. Path transformation in particular is now easier than it was before.
The Cover Texts are certain short passages of text that are listed as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
A Transparent copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup or absence of markup has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not Transparent is called Opaque.
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup Texinfo input format LaTeX input format SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD and standard-conforming simple HTML PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available and the machine-generated HTML PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.
A section Entitled XYZ means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below such as Acknowledgements Dedications Endorsements or History.) To Preserve the Title of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section Entitled XYZ according to this definition.
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License but only as regards disclaiming warranties any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.
Backwards Compatibility
Some old scripts could not be used with GIMP-2.4. This has been improved and 2.6 should run 2.0 and 2.2 scripts.
Known Problems
The Utility window hint is currently only known to work well in the Linux GNOME desktop environment and on Windows starting with GIMP 2.6.1.
Using the Text Tool is currently not an optimal experience. Making it work better is a goal for GIMP 2.8.

Grain extract mode is supposed to extract the film grain from a layer to produce a new layer that is pure grain but it can also be useful for giving images an embossed appearance. It subtracts the pixel value of the upper layer from that of the lower layer and adds 128.
Equation for layer mode Grain extract
There are two more layer modes but these are available only for painting tools. See Painting Modes for detailed information.
Example for layer mode Grain merge
Grain merge mode merges a grain layer (possibly one created from the Grain extract mode) into the current layer leaving a grainy version of the original layer. It does just the opposite of Grain extract. It adds the pixel values of the upper and lower layers together and subtracts 128.

Feathering is particularly useful when you are cutting and pasting so that the pasted object blends smoothly and unobtrusively with its surroundings.
It is possible to feather a selection at any time even if it was originally created as a sharp selection. Use SelectFeather from the image menu to open the Feather Selection dialog. Set the feather radius and click OK. Use SelectSharpen to do the oppositemdash;sharpen a graduated selection into an all-or-nothing selection.
For technically oriented readers feathering works by applying a Gaussian blur to the selection channel with the specified blurring radius.
Making a Selection Partially Transparent
You can set layer opacity but you cannot do that directly for a selection. It is quite useful to make the image of a glass transparent. Use the following methods to set the layer opacity
A GIMP image may be quite a complicated thing. Instead of thinking of it as a sheet of paper with a picture on it think of it as more like a stack of sheets called layers. In addition to a stack of layers a GIMP image may contain a selection mask a set of channels and a set of paths. In fact GIMP provides a mechanism for attaching arbitrary pieces of data called parasites to an image.
In GIMP it is possible to have many images open at the same time. Although large images may use many megabytes of memory GIMP uses a sophisticated tile-based memory management system that allows GIMP to handle very large images gracefully. There are limits however and having more memory available may improve system performance.
If a simple image can be compared to a single sheet of paper an image with layers is likened to a sheaf of transparent papers stacked one on top of the other. You can draw on each paper but still see the content of the other sheets through the transparent areas. You can also move one sheet in relation to the others. Sophisticated GIMP users often deal with images containing many layers even dozens of them. Layers need not be opaque and they need not cover the entire extent of an image so when you look at an image's display you may see more than just the top layer you may see elements of many layers.
Digital images comprise of a grid of square elements of varying colors called pixels. Each image has a pixel size such as 900 pixels wide by 600 pixels high. But pixels don't have a set size in physical space. To set up an image for printing we use a value called resolution defined as the ratio between an image's size in pixels and its physical size (usually in inches) when it is printed on paper. Most file formats (but not all) can save this value which is expressed as ppi mdash; pixels per inch. When printing a file the resolution value determines the size the image will have on paper and as a result the physical size of the pixels. The same 900x600 pixel image may be printed as a small 3x2" card with barely noticeable pixels mdash; or as a large poster with large chunky pixels. Images imported from cameras and mobile devices tend to have a resolution value attached to the file. The value is usually 72 or 96ppi. It is important to realize that this value is arbitrary and was chosen for historic reasons. You can always change the resolution value inside GIMPmdash; this has no effect on the actual image pixels. Furthermore for uses such as displaying images on line on mobile devices television or video games mdash; in short any use that is not print mdash; the resolution value is meaningless and is ignored and instead the image is usually displayed so that each image pixel conforms to one screen pixel.
A Channel is a single component of a pixel's color. For a colored pixel in GIMP these components are usually Red Green Blue and sometimes transparency (Alpha). For a Grayscale image they are Gray and Alpha and for an Indexed color image they are Indexed and Alpha.

In the active layer the filter creates a selection from the alpha channel and fills the selection with the specified gradient blend or pattern.
Then a new outline layer below the active layer will be created in a similar way First the active layer's alpha will be used to make a selection. But before filling the selection with a gradient or a pattern the selection will be enlarged by Outline size pixels.
When you filled both layers with the same pattern or gradient blend you will still see a border (outline) because
the layer mode of the active layer will be set to Screen.
The last (optional) step is to fill the outline layer with a pattern using the overlay layer mode. This will combine the pattern with the pattern or gradient used before. To learn more about the result of using the overlay mode see the description in .
The Weave command is a Script-Fu script which creates a new layer filled with a weave effect and adds it to the image as an overlay or bump map. The result of the image looks as if it were printed over woven ribbons of paper thin wooden sheet or stripped bamboo.
If the image is in indexed colors this menu entry is grayed out and unavailable.
This filter adds a Multiply mode layer upon the layer where you activate this command. The weave texture is rendered in gray levels.
This filter is found in the image window menu under FiltersArtisticWeave.

Filter Oilify applied
This filter makes the image look like an oil painting. The Mask size controls the outcome a high value gives the image less detail as if you had used a larger brush.
This variable specifies how intense the color of the squares should be. This affects the opacity of the squares. A high value will render the squares very intensely and does not allow lower squares to show through. A lower value allows the lower squares to be more visible through the higher ones and causes more blending in the colors. If this is set to 0 and Use Background Color is not checked the entire layer will be rendered black. If it is checked and the value here is zero the background color will fill the entire layer.
Use background color
This filter creates its tiles from all the colors of the image and paint them with a color scale which depends on the Tile Saturation. With a low Tile Saturation this color scale lets the background color appear default is black as you can see by setting Tile Saturation to 0. When this option is checked the background color of the Toolbox is used. If your image has an Alpha channel this color scale will also be transparent.

The Motion Blur filter blurs in a specific direction at each point which allows you to create a sense of motion either linear radial or rotational.
Finally the Tileable Blur filter is really the same thing as a Gaussian blur except that it wraps around the edges of an image to help you reduce edge effects when you create a pattern by tiling multiple copies of the image side by side.
Tileable Blur is actually implemented by a Script-Fu script that invokes the Gaussian blur plug-in.

Every image is associated with a map which works as a mask. Simply create this map as a grayscale gradient when applied onto the image dark areas of the mask will show the underlying image and bright areas will mask the image.
To work with this filter images and maps must have the same size. All images to be selected must be present on screen.
You can also use this filter on an image with several layers. All layers will appear in the drop-down lists used to select images. These layers must have the same size.

Applying example for the Difference of Gaussians filter
Filter Difference of Gaussians applied
This filter does edge detection using the so-called Difference of Gaussians algorithm which works by performing two different Gaussian blurs on the image with a different blurring radius for each and subtracting them to yield the result. This algorithm is very widely used in artificial vision (maybe in biological vision as well!) and is pretty fast because there are very efficient methods for doing Gaussian blurs. The most important parameters are the blurring radii for the two Gaussian blurs. It is probably easiest to set them using the preview but it may help to know that increasing the smaller radius tends to give thicker-appearing edges and decreasing the larger radius tends to increase the threshold for recognizing something as an edge. In most cases you will get nicer results if Radius 2 is smaller than Radius 1 but nothing prevents you from reversing them and in situations where you have a light figure on the dark background reversing them may actually improve the result.

Red Eye Removal applied
The aim of this filter is - guess what - to remove red eyes from an image. Before applying the Red Eye Removal you must do a selection (lasso or elliptical) of the boundary of the iris of the eye(s) having a red pupil. After only you can apply the filter on this selection. If you don't make this selection the filter inform you that  Manually selecting the eyes may improve the results.

To be listed in this drop-down list the displacement map which should be a grayscaled image must be present on your screen when you call filter and must have the same size as the original image.
Once all pixels displaced this option scatters them randomly giving grain to the image. The higher this value (0.00-100.00) the thinner the grain.
With a 3.00 dither size
This option sets displacement angle of pixels according to the slope direction of gradient. Previous examples have been created with a vertical gradient and a 90¬∞ angle so pixels were displaced horizontally and nothing went out of the image borders. Here is an example with a 10¬∞ angle and 6 iterations
With a 10¬∞ angle and 6 iterations
What you enter in input boxes directly or by using arrow-head buttons is not the actual displacement. It's a coefficient used in a  $displacement = (intensity x coefficient)$  formula which gives the pixel actual displacement according to the scaled intensity  of the corresponding pixel in map modulated by the coefficient you enter. Introducing intensity into formula is important this allows progressive displacement by using a gradient map.
This value may be positive or negative. A negative displacement is reverse of a positive one. The value varies in limits equal to the double of image dimensions.
When you click on the drop-down list button a list appears where you can select a displacement map. To be present in this list an image must respect two conditions. First this image must be present on your screen when you call filter. Then this image must have the same dimensions as the original image. Most often it will be a duplicate original image which is transformed to grey scale and modified appropriately with a gradient. It may be possible to use RGB images but color luminosity is used making result prevision difficult. Map may be different in horizontal and vertical directions.

When you have many fractals with different colors the colors blend into each other. So even if you set pure red for a fractal it might actually be quite blue in some places while another red  fractal might have a lot of yellow in it. Scale Hue/Value changes the color strength of the active fractal or how influential that fractal color should be.

A Brief Tutorial
This is a rather complex plug-in so to help you understand it we'll guide you through an example where you'll create a leaf or branch.
Filter Flame applied
With the Flame filter you can create stunning randomly generated fractal patterns. You can't control the fractals as you can with the IFS Fractal filter but you can steer the random generator in a certain direction and choose from variations of a theme you like.
Unfortunately it turned out that this filter is not working properly for large images. Even more unfortunate is that its developer is currently not undertaking any actions with that plug-in at all so there seems no quick fix in sight. Although we can't give you the exact numbers the plug-in worked in a quick test for a 1024x768 pixel image but didn't do it for a 2500x2500 pixel image.
This plug-in was given to GIMP by Scott Draves in 1997. He also holds the copyright for the plug-in. An descriptive page for the plug-in provided by the author can be found in the internet .

Incremental mode is a tool option that is shared by several brush tools except those which have a rate control which automatically implies an incremental effect. You can set it by checking the Incremental checkbox in the tool option dialog for the tool (Paintbrush Pencil and Eraser).
Indexed Colors
Indexed colors
Indexed color mode is a mode for encoding colors in an image where each pixel in the image is assigned an 8-bit color number. The color which corresponds to this number is then put in a table (the palette). Changing a color in the palette changes all the pixels which refer to this palette color. Although you can create images in Indexed Color mode and can transform images to it it is strictly speaking not a color model.
See also the Indexed Palette section and the Convert Image to Indexed Colors command.
From the three generated components Y U and V the individual color proportions of the basic color can be calculated again later
Y + U = Y + ( B - Y ) = Y - Y + B = B
Y + V = Y + ( R - Y ) = Y - Y + R = R
Y - B - R = ( R + G + B ) - B - R = G
Furthermore because of the structure of the retina of the human eye it turns out that the brightness information is perceived at a higher resolution than the color so that many formats based on the YUV color model compress the chrominance to save bandwidth during transmission.

The Select Menu
Introduction to the Select Menu
The Contents of the Select menu
This section explains the commands on the Select menu of the image menubar.
The way the stretching is done varies with the different commands and the results look different. It is not easy to predict exactly what each command will do. If you know exactly what you are doing you can get the same results and even more with the Levels tool.
Here are examples of the results of these commands all together on one page so you can compare them more easily. The most appropriate command depends upon your image so you should try each of them to see which command works best on it.
The original layer and its histograms
This layer doesn't have any very bright or very dark pixels so it works well with these commands.
The Equalize command
The chart the curve is drawn on a grid and goes from the bottom left corner to the top right corner. The pointer x/y position is permanently displayed in the top left part of the grid. By default this curve is straight because every input level corresponds to the same ouput tone. GIMP automatically places an anchor at both ends of the curve for black (0) and white (255).
If you click on the curve a new anchor is created. When the mouse pointer goes over an anchor it takes the form of a small hand. You can click-and-drag the anchor to bend the curve. If you click outside of the curve an anchor is also created and the curve includes it automatically.
Unactive anchors are black. The active anchor is white. You can activate an anchor by clicking on it. You can also swap the anchor activation by using the Left and Right arrow keys of your keyboard. You can move the anchor vertically with the Up and Down arrow keys. This allows you to fine tune the anchor position. Holding the Shift down lets you move it by increments of 15 pixels.
Two anchors define a curve segment which represents a tonal range in the layer. You can click-and-drag this segment (this creates a new anchor). Of course you can't drag it beyond the end anchors.
To delete all anchors (apart from both ends) click on the Reset Channel button. To delete only one anchor move beyond any adjacent anchor on horizontal axis.
The Level tool provides features similar to the Histogram dialog but can also change the intensity range of the active layer or selection in every channel. This tool is used to make an image lighter or darker to change contrast or to correct a predominant color cast.
You can get to this tools in several ways
By clicking on the tool icon  in the toolbox if this tool has been installed there. For this please refer to .

The image is created in the Red Green Blue color system which is the one used by your monitor or your television screen.
The image is created in black and white with various shades of gray. Aside from your artistic interests this type of image may be necessary for some plug-ins. Nevertheless the GIMP allows you to change an RGB image into grayscale if you would like.
You cannot create an indexed image directly with this menu but of course you can always convert the image to indexed mode after it has been created. To do that use the ImageModeIndexed command.
Here you specify the background color that is used for your new image. It is certainly possible to change the background of an image later too. You can find more information about doing that in the Layer dialog.

To take full advantage of GIMP's internal 32-bit floating point processing choose 32-bit floating point precision and also choose the Linear light channel encoding.
If you are editing on a machine with limited RAM or if you are editing very large images and layer stacks consider using 16-bit floating point or integer precision.
If you want to take advantage of high bit depth image editing but you don't want to deal with floating point channel values then use 16-bit integer precision.
When soft proofing an image switch to Perceptual gamma (sRGB) channel encoding to avoid certain problems with soft proofing a linear gamma image using Little CMS.
On a very low-spec machine with not very much RAM consider using 8-bit integer precision in which case also choose the Perceptual gamma (sRGB) channel encoding (at 8-bit precision if you choose the Linear light channel encoding your image will have horribly posterized shadows).

The Fullscreen command enables and disables displaying the image window on the entire screen. When it is enabled the image window takes up the whole screen but the image stays the same size. When you enable full-screen mode the menubar may not be displayed but if this happens you can right-click on the image to access the image menu. You can set the default appearance for full-screen mode in the Preferences menu.
Pressing the Tab key toggles the visibility of all present docks.
If you use GIMP on an Apple computer full-screen mode may not work since Apple doesn't provide the necessary functionality. Instead you can maximize the image window by clicking on the Green Button so the image occupies most of the screen.
You can access this command from the image menubar through ViewFull Screen
You can also make settings regarding zooming in the Navigation dialog. You can also use the Zoom tool which lets you zoom a particular area of the image.
Contents of the Zoom submenu
The various Zoom submenu commands are described below along with their default keyboard shortcuts if any.
The keyboard shortcut for Zoom In has been somewhat controversial because this is a very common operation and on English keyboards the Shift key must be pressed to use it. (This is not the case for European keyboards.) If you would like to have a different keyboard shortcut you can create a dynamic shortcut for it; see the help section for User Interface Preferences for instructions.
(Shortcut ShiftCtrlJ). This command zooms the image to be as large as possible while still keeping it completely within the window. There will usually be padding on two sides of the image but not on all four sides.

You know spacing in brush strokes strokes are made of successive brush marks which when they are very near seem to draw a continuous line. Here instead of being aligned brush marks are scattered over a distance you can set with the Amount slider.
Jitter example
From top to bottom without jitter jitter = 1 jitter = 4.
Jitter is also available in the Paint Dynamic Editor where you can connect jitter to the behavior of the brush.
Original images for clone alignment
We will use the largest brush with the Pencil tool. The source is represented here with a ringed cross.
An image with a solid background only. We shall draw three cloning strokes successively.
In this mode each brushstroke is treated separately. For each stroke the point where you first click is copied from the source origin; there is no relationship between one brush stroke and another. In non-aligned mode different brush strokes will usually clash if they intersect each other.
Example below At every new brush stroke the source goes back to its first position. The same sample is always cloned.
Fade (mouse) The start color is collected from the left side of the gradient and then more and more from the right side during the stroke. The behavior of the fading is set in the Fade Options in the Tool Options Dialog.
The hardness option is useful only for fuzzy brushes.
Velocity (mouse) At slow speed the brush is hard and become more fuzzy as the speed increase.
Random (mouse) The fussiness of the brush varies at random.
Fade(mouse) The brush become less fuzzy during the stroke. The behavior of the fading is set in the Fade Options in the Tool Options Dialog.

Creating and Using Selections
Moving a Selection
Every statement in Scheme is surrounded by parentheses ().
The second thing you need to know is that
The function name/operator is always the first item in the parentheses and the rest of the items are parameters to the function.
However not everything enclosed in parentheses is a function mdash; they can also be items in a list mdash; but we'll get to that later. This notation is referred to as prefix notation because the function prefixes everything else. If you're familiar with postfix notation or own a calculator that uses Reverse Polish Notation (such as most HP calculators) you should have no problem adapting to formulating expressions in Scheme.
The third thing to understand is that
To access the values in a list use the functions car and cdr which return the first element of the list and the rest of the list respectively. These functions break the list down into the headtail construct I mentioned earlier.
The car Function
car returns the first element of the list (the head of the list). The list needs to be non-null. Thus the following returns the first element of the list
(car '("first" 2 "third"))
The cdr function
Now that we have the text we can grab its width and height and resize the image and the image's layer to the text's size
If you're like me you're probably wondering what a drawable is when compared to a layer. The difference between the two is that a drawable is anything that can be drawn into including layers but also channels layer masks the selection etc; a layer is a more specific version of a drawable. In most cases the distinction is not important.
With the image ready to go we can now re-add our display line

Clearing The Dirty Flag
Adjusting Sharpness
Unblurring
If the focus on the camera is not set perfectly or the camera is moving when the picture is taken the result is a blurred image. If there is a lot of blurring you probably won't be able to do much about it with any technique but if there is only a moderate amount you should be able to improve the image.
Sometimes using Unsharp Mask can cause color distortion where there are strong contrasts in an image. When this happens you can often get better results by decomposing the image into separate Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) layers and running Unsharp Mask on the Value layer only then recomposing. This works because the human eye has much finer resolution for brightness than for color. See the sections on Decompose and Compose for more information.
Next to "Unsharp Mask" in the Filters menu is another filter called Sharpen which does similar things. It is a little easier to use but not nearly as effective our recommendation is that you ignore it and go straight to Unsharp Mask.
The line after the second click
The line created appears in the image window after drawing the second point (or end point) while the Shift key is still pressed.
If you're satisfied with the direction and length of the line click the left mouse button again to finish the line. The GIMP displays a straight line now. If the line doesn't appear check the foreground and background colors and be sure that you kept the Shift key pressed while painting. You can keep creating lines by continuing to hold the Shift key and creating additional end points.

This page lets you customize the way windows are handled in GIMP. You should note that GIMP does not manipulate windows directly instead it sends requests to the window manager (i. e. to Windows if you are running in Windows; to Metacity if you are running in a standard Gnome setup in Linux; etc). Because there are many window managers and not all of them are well behaved it cannot be guaranteed that the functions described here will actually work as described. However if you are using a modern standards-compliant window manager they ought to.

The Tableau is built down by suit. Only the top card or build of cards can be moved. A build of cards can only be moved if the number of cards in the build is equal or less than one more than the number of Reserve slots free. Empty spaces in the Tableau can only be filled with a King or a build starting with a King.
Foundations are built up by suit from Ace to King. Although cards in the Foundations are technically still in play there really is no need as playing these cards are not in any way helpful.
Any top card in the Tableau can be placed in an empty Reserve slot. These cards are available for play back into the Tableau or on to a Foundation pile.
Each card placed on to the Foundation piles scores one point.
Move any card you can on to the Foundations as soon as possible. Leaving them around can only hinder your movement.
If more than one pile on the tableau can be built upon choose to build upon the one with the highest rank first.
Author's note These definitions are meant as a guideline only. See individual game rules as any game has the right to redefine or modify the rules to make it fun.
Base card
The first card dealt into a foundation pile. Other foundations usually have to start with a card of this rank. See Foundation
Build by alternate color
Each card removed from the Tableau scores one point.
Try to plan ahead so that you can make runs in the future.
Top left pile. All cards are placed here in beginning. When emptied cards are brought back from Tableau and put back in the Stock.
Four piles on the right. Each deal from Stock will deal one card to each Tableau pile.
Clicking on the Stock will deal one card to each of the Tableau piles. If any of the cards showing in the Tableau are of the same rank move the others on to the leftmost of the like cards. Empty piles can only be filled by an ensuing deal from Stock.
Remove cards in pairs of equal rank. Every time a card is removed the card underneath is flipped face up and becomes playable. Empty slots are not filled.
Each pile starts with four cards. The trick is to remember how many cards each slot has left at any given time so that you can try to remove cards evenly.
Remove pairs of cards with the same rank. Empty piles are automatically filled from the Stock.
Remove pairs of cards as fast as possible. That is the only challenge.
Top left pile. All cards are placed here after dealing on the Tableau. Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste. One redeal.
Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in Foundations are no longer in play.
When game is dealt any sequence of cards going down in suit is awarded one point per card. Every move within the Tableau will award a point for every card in the newly created sequence. A point is also rewarded for every card placed on to the Foundation.
Maximum possible score 412
The more you can hold on to the more you will have. Try to keep cards out of Foundations as long as possible. The larger the sequences the more points are made.
Four spread piles on left. Deal three cards face down and one card face up in each Reserve pile. No building allowed.
If you want an extremely difficult challenge do not move completed sequences of cards to a foundation. You can also win by leaving the same eight sequences in the tableau. This is harder because there are fewer empty piles available. In fact it is nearly impossible.
Build down regardless of suit. Sequences of cards in the same suit can be moved as a unit. Empty piles can be filled with any card or legal sequence.
Clicking on the Stock pile at any time deals a card face up to every pile. However all piles must be non-empty. If an empty pile exists an error message will appear.
A sequence of cards going down from King down to Ace can be moved to a foundation pile. Once there these cards are no longer in play.
There are three possible types of deck. Each deck has 104 cards.
Progressive Rounds After all cards have been cleared from the tableu a new round begins. The score from the last round carries over into the new round.
The score for each card played is equal to the number of cards your have played since the last card flipped from the Stock to the Waste. The longer the run the higher your score.
5 points are deducted when you flip a card from Stock to Waste. Each triangle peak cleared will give a 15 point bonus and an additional 15 points are awarded when all the cards have been cleared from the Tableau.
Maximum possible score for a single round 466
Deal face up a four by four grid for the Tableau making sixteen piles. Top card of each pile available for play.

XDMCP - X Display Manage Protocol
Xserver - An implementation of the X Window System. For example the Xorg Xserver provided by the X.org Foundation http//www.x.org.
Paths that start with a word in angle brackets are relative to the installation prefix. I.e. lt;sharegt;/pixmaps/ refers to /usr/share/pixmaps if GDM was configured with --prefix=/usr.
The GNOME Display Manager (GDM) is a display manager that implements all significant features required for managing attached and remote displays. GDM was written from scratch and does not contain any XDM or X Consortium code.
Note that GDM is configurable and many configuration settings have an impact on security. Issues to be aware of are highlighted in this document.
The GDM script integration points can be found in the lt;etcgt;/gdm/ directory
The Init PostLogin PreSession and PostSession scripts all work as described below.
For each type of script the default one which will be executed is called "Default" and is stored in a directory associated with the script type. So the default Init script is lt;etcgt;/gdm/Init/Default. A per-display script can be provided and if it exists it will be run instead of the default script. Such scripts are stored in the same directory as the default script and have the same name as the Xserver DISPLAY value for that display. For example if the lt;Initgt;/0 script exists it will be run for DISPLAY "0".
All of these scripts are run with root privilege and return 0 if run successfully and a non-zero return code if there was any failure that should cause the login session to be aborted. Also note that GDM will block until the scripts finish so if any of these scripts hang this will cause the login process to also hang.
When the Xserver for the login GUI has been successfully started but before the login GUI is actually displayed GDM will run the Init script. This script is useful for starting programs that should be run while the login screen is showing or for doing any special initialization if required.
If the Xserver does not respond in the specified number of seconds then the connection is stopped and the session ended. When this happens the daemon dies with an ALARM signal. Note that GDM 2.20 and earlier multiplied this setting by 2 so it may be necessary to increase the timeout if upgrading from GDM 2.20 and earlier to a newer version.
Note that GDM in the past used to have a PingInterval configuration key which was also in minutes. For most purposes you'd want this setting to be lower than one minute. However since in most cases where XDMCP would be used (such as terminal labs) a lag of more than 15 or so seconds would really mean that the terminal was turned off or restarted and you would want to end the session.
Port=177
The UDP port number gdm should listen to for XDMCP requests. Do not change this unless you know what you are doing.

In general you will want to back up files that are irreplaceable and files that require a great time investment to replace without a backup. If things are easy to replace on the other hand you may not want to use up disk space by having backups of them.
Advice on where to store your backups and what type of storage device to use.
Where to store your backup
You should store backup copies of your files somewhere separate from your computer ‚Äî on an external hard disk for example. That way if the computer breaks the backup will still be intact. For maximum security you shouldn‚Äôt keep the backup in the same building as your computer. If there is a fire or theft both copies of the data could be lost if they are kept together.
It is important to choose an appropriate backup medium too. You need to store your backups on a device that has sufficient disk capacity for all of the backed-up files.
You can change how the hour is displayed by selecting 24-hour or AM/PM for Time Format.
You may also wish to set the timezone manually.

Change your timezone
If you have Automatic Time Zone set to ON your time zone should update automatically if you have an internet connection and the location services feature is enabled. To update your time zone manually set this to OFF.
You should carefully check the redistribution conditions for profiles downloaded from vendor websites or that were created on your behalf.
Color profiles are provided by vendors and can be generated yourself.
Where do I get color profiles?
The best way to get profiles is to generate them yourself although this does require some initial outlay.
Many manufacturers do try to provide color profiles for devices although sometimes they are wrapped up in driver bundles which you may need to download extract and then search for the color profiles.
To add a detail such as a new phone number or email address press New Detail and select the field that you want to add.

How to check why your mouse is not working.
Mouse pointer is not moving
Check that the mouse is plugged in
If you have a mouse with a cable check that it is firmly plugged in to your computer.
If it is a USB mouse (with a rectangular connector) try plugging it in to a different USB port. If it is a PS/2 mouse (with a small round connector with six pins) make sure that it is plugged in to the green mouse port rather than the purple keyboard port. You may need to restart the computer if it was not plugged in.

There are a number of different types of VPN. You may have to install some extra software depending on what type of VPN you‚Äôre connecting to. Find out the connection details from whoever is in charge of the VPN and see which VPN client you need to use. Then go to the software installer application and search for the NetworkManager package which works with your VPN (if there is one) and install it.
If there isn‚Äôt a NetworkManager package for your type of VPN you will probably have to download and install some client software from the company that provides the VPN software. You‚Äôll probably have to follow some different instructions to get that working.
To set up the VPN connection
At the bottom of the list on the left click the + button to add a new connection.
Choose VPN in the interface list.
Most Linux distributions keep a list of wireless devices that they have support for. Sometimes these lists provide extra information on how to get the drivers for certain adapters working properly. Go to the list for your distribution (for example Ubuntu Arch Fedora or openSUSE) and see if your make and model of wireless adapter is listed. You may be able to use some of the information there to get your wireless drivers working.
Look for restricted (binary) drivers.
Many Linux distributions only come with device drivers which are free and open source. This is because they cannot distribute drivers which are proprietary or closed-source. If the correct driver for your wireless adapter is only available in a non-free or ‚Äúbinary-only‚Äù version it may not be installed by default. If this is the case look on the wireless adapter manufacturer‚Äôs website to see if they have any Linux drivers.
Some Linux distributions have a tool that can download restricted drivers for you. If your distribution has one of these use it to see if it can find any wireless drivers for you.
Use the Windows drivers for your adapter.
Tips to reduce the power consumption of your computer.
Use less power and improve battery life
Computers can use a lot of power. By using some simple energy-saving strategies you can reduce your energy bill and help the environment.
General tips
Suspend your computer when you are not using it. This significantly reduces the amount of power it uses and it can be woken up very quickly.
You should save all of your work before suspending the computer just in case something goes wrong and your open applications and documents cannot be recovered when you resume the computer again.
The screen will dim when the computer is idle in order to save power.
Why does my screen go dim after a while?
If it is possible to set the brightness of your screen it will dim when the computer is idle in order to save power. When you start using the computer again the screen will brighten.
To stop the screen from dimming itself
The first is that your printer knows what size the envelope is. Press CtrlP to open the Print dialog go to the Page Setup tab and choose the Paper type as ‚ÄúEnvelope‚Äù if you can. If you cannot do this see if you can change the Paper size to an envelope size (for example C5). The pack of envelopes will say what size they are; most envelopes come in standard sizes.
Secondly you need to make sure that the envelopes are loaded with the right side up in the printer‚Äôs in-tray. Check the printer‚Äôs manual for this or try to print a single envelope and check which side is printed on to see which way is the right way up.
Some printers are not designed to be able to print envelopes especially some laser printers. Check your printer‚Äôs manual to see if it accepts envelopes. Otherwise you could damage the printer by feeding an envelope in.
Check the amount of ink or toner left in printer cartridges.
How can I check my printer‚Äôs ink or toner levels?
Ensure the Recently Used switch is ON.
Select the length of time to Retain History. Choose from options 1 day 7 days 30 days or Forever.

A user with administrative privileges is sometimes called a super user. This is simply because that user has more privileges than normal users. You might see people discussing things like su and sudo; these are programs for temporarily giving you ‚Äúsuper user‚Äù (administrative) privileges.
Why are administrative privileges useful?
Requiring users to have administrative privileges before important system changes are made is useful because it helps to prevent your system from being broken intentionally or unintentionally.
If you had administrative privileges all of the time you might accidentally change an important file or run an application which changes something important by mistake. Only getting administrative privileges temporarily when you need them reduces the risk of these mistakes happening.
Only certain trusted users should be allowed to have administrative privileges. This prevents other users from messing with the computer and doing things like uninstalling applications that you need installing applications that you don‚Äôt want or changing important files. This is useful from a security standpoint.

How to connect to a database using libgda
How to insert and browse records in a database table
This demo uses the Javascript language. We are going to demonstrate how to connect and use a database from a GTK program by using the GDA (GNOME Data Access) library. Thus you also need this library installed.
GNOME Data Access (GDA) is library whose purpose is to provide universal access to different kinds and types of data sources. This goes from traditional relational database systems to any imaginable kind of data source such as a mail server a LDAP directory etc. For more information and for a full API and documentation visit the GDA website.
Although a big part of the code is related to user interface (GUI) we are going to focus our tutorial on the database parts (we might mention other parts we think are relevant though). To know more about Javascript programs in GNOME see the Image Viewer program tutorial.
Setting brightness and Contrast
Some scanners allow the user to adjust the brightness and contrast when scanning. If your scans come out too dark or too light you can adjust these settings from the DocumentPreferences menu.
The cropping feature in Simple Scan allows you to use only a part of a scanned image. You can enable crop either before or after scanning a page and you can always change the dimensions of the crop frame. When crop is enabled a mask will appear over the current page with the area not being used shown in gray. You can enable crop and choose the desired dimensions via one of the following methods
Use a Right Click
Right click anywhere on the image area and select "Crop".

Initial Speed
Usually threshold values should not be changed but this option is useful for special cases.
Default value 50 ms.
On jumps with contact platforms a value of 50 ms (3 cm jump approximately) is enough to solve electronical problems.
You may change this value if you have a jumper that loses pressure with the platform while going down previous to a CMJ or ABK jump.
This jumper should change his technique but if it's difficult a solution is to increase threshold.

Unfortunately CPU frequency scaling can currently only be monitored on Linux machines that have support in the kernel. It can however support the several generations of frequency scaling interfaces in the kernel.
The second most important idea is that what you have written depends only on where you finally end up in the library not on how you got there; so there is no need to steer accurately on your way to your destination. You are allowed to cut corners. (For example in the previous image if you wanted to write `objectsare' it would be fine to move the mouse straight towards the letters `are' even if this takes the mouse across the unwanted grey `i' square.)
Common errors. Often a beginner who is trying to find a particular letter will drive the display forwards fast while hunting for the letter. The rule of the road for Dasher users is just like that for car-drivers don't drive forwards until you have identified where you want to go! So after you have found the first letter of your sentence and zoomed towards it please SLOW DOWN and don't proceed any further into this first letter's square until you have figured out where you should be steering towards. Your next letter is there immediately inside the first square you have entered. The letters are ordered alphabetically. If you can't see your letter figure out where it must be on the basis of the letters you can see. Then point to the right place and enter the second letter's square.
Writing I once had a whim;. Where should the user steer now?
Imagine you want to write `I once had a whim'. You write `I once ha' and the Dasher display looks like . You want to write `had'. What should you do? There are lots of letter ds on the screen and all of them are rather small. The five arrows in  show some of these ds. The purple arrow points to a d that we can't see yet but we know it must be there because we can see `a' `b' and `c' above it.
Some alternative letter ds with a beginner's error highlighted
Set up menu button-Dasher as described above and use the third button as your escape key -- to make Dasher go away for example. [This feature is not currently provided within Dasher.]
In direct button-Dasher each button produces a particular navigation action such as `up' `down' or `back'. If you have 2.5 buttons map the convenient two to `up' and `down' and the inconvenient button to `back'.
You can use direct button-Dasher or menu button-Dasher as described above.
4 5 6 or 7
With more than three buttons you have the option to use direct button-Dasher with three four five or six `forward' directions. Please try menu button-Dasher too even though it uses only two buttons.

Basic Usage
Calling and being called
From computer to computer (PC-To-PC)
If you want to call other users and to be callable you need a SIP address. You can get a SIP address from http//www.ekiga.net as described above.
The SIP address can be used by other users to call you. Similarly you can use the SIP address of your friends and family to call them. You can for example use sipdsandras@ekiga.net to call the author of Ekiga.
1. The "listenport" value is the port Ekiga will use to listen for incoming connections. It is different for SIP and H.323.
2. The "udpportrange" value is the range of UDP ports that Ekiga will use for SIP signalling or when registering to H.323 gatekeepers. It is also used for RTP (audio and video communication channels).
3. The "tcpportrange" value is the range of TCP ports beside the listenport that Ekiga will use for the H.245 channel with the H.323 protocol. That port range is not used by SIP. It is also not used when H.245 Tunneling is enabled which is generally the case except when calling old H.323 implementations like Netmeeting.

To identify which clips are not being used in your project use the Select clips that have not been used in the project button at the left side of the search bar. Unused clips will then be selected in the media library.
If there are no unused clips in your project nothing will be selected in the media library.
There are three further actions you can perform with clips. Each is represented by a button in the upper right part of the Media Library
Remove selected clips from the project (this can also be performed by pressing ControlDelete).
Clip properties opens a new window with information on video size frame rate and aspect ratio. Clicking the Apply to project button adjusts the project settings to the clip properties. You can select which properties to apply by leaving them ticked/unticked.
Cutting out the middle
When you want to cut out a middle section of a clip split the clip twice on the positions where the part you want to remove begins and ends. Select the middle part and hit Delete. Now eliminate the empty space between the remaining two parts by moving one of them towards the other until they snap.
What kind of hardware is needed to do video editing?
System requirements
In terms of hardware video editing typically requires a powerful computer depending on the type of video you are editing. While the processing power of computers has increased tremendously over the years so has demand for higher quality video. Editing HD (High Definition) video usually requires (at the time of this writing) state of the art hardware (depending on the codec used) while SD (Standard Definition) video editing can be done on modest hardware configurations. It is up to you to make sure that your equipment is adequate. It should at least be able to playback your media in Totem without lagging.
Once a property becomes controlled the widget for editing the property value directly is disabled. To remove the keyframes and be able to set again directly a constant value using the widget you have to click the Reset to default value button. For more information on how to use keyframes see the Keyframe curves page.
If there is no Show keyframes for this value button next to the effect variable it cannot be controlled with keyframes.

Hint How to hide your key code
A useful way to hide your key code is to write it down like a credit card number i.e. by also including an expiration date.
You have not set up your encryption key so the files will not be encrypted prior to being stored on the server.
This may lead to unintended access to the files by the server administrator or others in case the server is compromised.
This is an email to notify you that the whistleblower of submission {TipNum} has attached new material.

The HTTPS certificate loaded on the platform is about to or has already expired.
Expiration date {ExpirationDate}
Without a valid certificate the platform will be accessible in a secure way only via Tor.
Duplicate Entriesquot;Tools gt; Database Processing gt; Find Possible Duplicate Peoplequot; allows you to locate (and merge) entries of the same person entered more than once in the database.
Merging EntriesThe function quot;Edit gt; Compare and Mergequot; allows you to combine separately listed people into one. Select the second entry by holding the Control key as you click. This is very useful for combining two databases with overlapping people or combining erroneously entered differing names for one individual. This also works for the Places Sources and Repositories views.
Organising the ViewsMany of the views can present your data as either a hierarchical tree or as a simple list. Each view can also be configured to the way you like it. Have a look to the right of the top toolbar or under the quot;Viewquot; menu.
Navigating Back and ForwardGramps maintains a list of previous active objects such as People and Events. You can move forward and backward through the list using quot;Go gt; Forwardquot; and quot;Go gt; Backquot; or the arrow buttons.
Keyboard ShortcutsTired of having to take your hand off the keyboard to use the mouse? Many functions in Gramps have keyboard shortcuts. If one exists for a function it is displayed on the right side of the menu.

Unable to construct a requested GUI element. This is most likely because the GUI specification data file (kmldonkeyui.rc) has been installed in the wrong location or has not been installed at all. If you installed KMLDonkey from a binary package please report this to the packager at once. If you installed from source check that you configured KMLDonkey to use the same install prefix as your KDE installation (see the README file accompanying the KMLDonkey source for details) and that your system does not keep KDE files in non-standard locations (Mandriva Linux systems in particular are known to do this).

 Coloration Preview Thumbnail The coloration preview thumbnail indicates change of image coloration by different settings. Options to influence output are   Brightness    Hue (Tint)    Saturation    Gamma            For a more detailed explanation about Brightness Hue Saturation and Gamma settings please look at the 'What's This' items provided for these controls.

Click on horizontal and vertical radio buttons to move image alignment on paper around. Options are   center        top           top-left      left          bottom-left   bottom        bottom-right  right         top-right      
 Reset to Default Values Reset all coloration settings to default values. Default values are   Brightness 100   Hue (Tint).   0   Saturation 100   Gamma     1000    
  Image Positioning Select a pair of radio buttons to move the image to the position you want on the paper printout. Default is 'center'.    Additional hint for power users This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter     -o position=       # examples "top-left" or "bottom"   
Hue (Color rotation)
 Page size Select paper size to be printed on from the drop-down menu. The exact list of choices depends on the printer driver ("PPD") you have installed.   Additional hint for power users This KDEPrint GUI element correponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter     -o PageSize=         # examples "A4" or "Letter"    
 Paper type Select paper type to be printed on from the drop-down menu.  The exact list of choices depends on the printer driver ("PPD") you have installed.

 Duplex Printing These controls may be grayed out if your printer does not support duplex printing (i.e. printing on both sides of the sheet.) These controls are active if your printer supports duplex printing. You can choose from 3 alternatives  None. This prints each page of the job on one side of the sheets only. Long Side. This prints the job on both sides of the paper sheets. It prints the job in a way so that the backside has the same orientation as the front side if you fold the paper over the long edge. (Some printer drivers call this mode duplex-non-tumbled.) Short Side. This prints the job on both sides of the paper sheets. It prints the job so that the backside has the reverse orientation from the front side if you turn the paper over the long edge but the same orientation if you turn it over the short edge.

The R backend will be shut down immediately. This means you can not use any more functions that rely on it. I.e. you can do hardly anything at all not even save the workspace (but if you're lucky R already did that). What you can do however is save any open command-files the output or copy data out of open data editors. Quit RKWard after that. Sorry!

If you need access to the raw HTML and image files these are stored in a hidden directory. By default this is a sub-folder called ".rkward" of your home directory (Settings->Configure RKWard->General). You'll want the files "rkout.html" and the "graph*.png" files.
The screen device history provides an interface to flip through your plots similar a web browser. The current implementation understands most function calls from the graphics and lattice packages. Adding other graphical engines is planned for future. See the Technical Details section below for more information.
The screen device history is only accessible from an open screen device under the History menu. It is available on most screen device windows. Such devices are called "managed" devices for the purpose of this help page. File devices such as png pdf etc. are not obviously affected by this screen history implementation and hence they are not managed. In addition "preview" devices which are available on some of the plugins are not managed either.
Several actions are available either from the History menu or from the toolbar icons on a managed device. The displayed icons on the toolbar can be configured from the device window's Settings->Configure Toolbars menu item.
Go to plot This provides a drop down list of all the plots stored in the history; giving an easily accessible "jumping" action. RKWard tries hard to identify the appropriate plot calls but this is not always feasible. In such cases a further attempt is made to identify the X label Y label and the Main titles of the plot and the displayed string looks like "X xlab; Y ylab; main". Sometimes even that is not possible (indicated by ). Plots which are pending to be saved are indicated by . The displayed strings are prepended with their corresponding position in the history. For the usual "linear browsing" see first / previous / next / last actions below.

The Dolphin file manager brings many small fixes and optimizations in this release. Loading large folders has been sped up and requires up to 30#37; less memory. Heavy disk and CPU activity is prevented by only loading previews around the visible items. There have been many more improvements for example many bugs that affected expanded folders in Details View were fixed no quot;unknownquot; placeholder icons will be shown any more when entering a folder and middle clicking an archive now opens a new tab with the archive contents creating a more consistent  experience overall.
The new send-later work flow in Kontact
Kontact Suite Improvements
The Kontact Suite has once again seen significant focus on stability performance and memory usage. Importing folders switching between maps fetching mail marking or moving large numbers of messages and startup time have all been improved in the last 6 months. See this blog for details. The archive functionality has seen many bug fixes and there have also been improvements in the ImportWizard allowing importing of settings from the Trojit√° mail client and better importing from various other applications. Find more information here.
The KDE Community proudly announces the latest major updates to KDE Applications delivering new features and fixes. Major improvements are made to KDE's Semantic Search technology benefiting many applications. With Plasma Workspaces and the KDE Development Platform frozen and receiving only long term support those teams are focusing on the transition to Frameworks 5. This release is translated into 53 languages; more languages are expected to be added in subsequent monthly minor bugfix releases.
The KDE Applications 4.13
The latest major updates to the KDE Applications are delivering new features and fixes. Kontact (the personal information manager) has been the subject of intense activity benefiting from the improvements to KDE's Semantic Search technology and bringing new features. Document viewer Okular and advanced text editor Kate have gotten interface-related and feature improvements. In the education and game areas we introduce the new foreign speech trainer Artikulate; Marble (the desktop globe) gets support for Sun Moon planets bicycle routing and nautical miles. Palapeli (the jigsaw puzzle application) has leaped to unprecedented new dimensions and capabilities. read the announcement.

A nice fix for desktop Kirigami applications The application window now has a default shortcut to close the application depending on the system preferences commonly Ctrl+Q.
Naturally this release also contains smaller fixes and general polishing.
New System Settings Design
System Settings New Design
The revamped System Settings user interface allows easier access to commonly used settings. It is the first step in making this often-used and complex application easier to navigate and more user-friendly. The new design is added as an option users who prefer the older icon or tree views can move back to their preferred way of navigation.
Notification History
Due to popular demand notifications optionally stores missed and expired notifications in a history. This is the first part of an ongoing effort to modernize the notification system in Plasma. This allows the user to override applications not marking their notifications as persistent and viewing what happened in her absence. The notifications history is enabled by default for testing purposes but may be switched off in the final 5.11 release as to provide a cleaner and uncluttered appearance out of the box. The Plasma team welcomes feedback from testers specifically about this new feature.
If you have been using our previous LTS release Plasma 5.8 you might notice some interesting changes when you upgrade to Plasma 5.12. All these great features are waiting for you
Due to popular demand we implemented switching between windows in Task Manager using Meta + number shortcuts for heavy multi-tasking. Also new in Task Manager is the ability to pin different applications in each of your activities. Is some app making noise in the background while you are trying to focus on one task? Applications currently playing audio are now marked with an icon similar to how it‚Äôs done in modern web browsers. Together with a button to mute the offending application this can help you stay focused.
Global Menus have returned. KDE's pioneering feature to separate the menu bar from the application window allows for a new user interface paradigm with either a Plasma Widget showing the menu or with the menu neatly tucked away in the window title bar. Setting it up has been greatly simplified in Plasma 5.12 as soon as you add the Global Menu widget or title bar button the required background service gets started automatically. No need to reload the desktop or click any confirmation buttons!
Spring-Loaded Folders
Folder View is now the default desktop layout. After some years of shunning icons on the desktop we have accepted the inevitable and changed to Folder View as the default desktop. This brings some icons to the desktop by default and allows you to put whatever files or folders you want on it for easy access. To make this work many improvements have been made to Folder View. Spring Loading makes drag-and- dropping files powerful and quick and there is a tighter icon grid along with massively improved performance.

To build adapt or use acoustic models of different types certain software needs to be installed.
Base model requirements
PocketSphinx
SphinxTrain PocketSphinx
All four tools HTK Julius PocketSphinx and SphinxTrain can safely be installed at the same time.
Current Simon versions include a graphical notice on when to speak during recording. The message will tell the user to wait for about half a second
before telling the user to speak
This method of visual feedback proved especially valuable when recording with people who cannot read the prompted text for themselves and therefore need someone to tell them what they have to say. The colorful visual cue tells them when to start repeating what the facilitator said without the need of unreliable hand gestures.
Generally we recommend to record roughly the same sentences that Simon should recognize later.
(Obviously that does not apply to massive sample acquisitions where other properties like phonetic balance are more important)
The above screenshot for example shows a setup where given that all samples of "peter" were tagged "peterssamples" and all samples of "mathias" were tagged "mathiassamples" (refer to the device configuration for more information on how to set up sample groups) the active acoustic model will only contain the current user's own samples as long as the file /home/bedahr/.username contains either "peter" or "mathias".
Another example use-case would be to switch to a more noise-resistant acoustic model when the user starts playing music.
Here you can adjust the parameters of the speech model.
You can optionally use base models to limit / circumvent the training or to avoid installing a model creation backend. Please refer to the general base model section for more details about base models.
Base model configuration
Speech recognition background
Before explaining exactly how you can create new scenarios with Simon this section introduces some fundamental basics to speech recognition in general.
Speech recognition systems take voice input (often from a microphone) and try to translate it into written text. To do that they rely on statistical representations of human voice. To put it into simple terms The computer learns how words - or more correctly the sounds that make up those words - sound.
A speech model consists of two distinct parts
Acoustic Model
If you do not know how to transcribe a word yourself you can easily use your shadow dictionary to help you with the transcription - even if the word is not listed in it. Let's say we want to add the word Firefox (to launch firefox) which is of course not listed in our shadow dictionary.
(I imported the English voxforge HTK lexicon available from voxforge as a shadow dictionary.)
Firefox is not listed in our shadow dictionary so we do not get any suggestion at all.
Adding an unknown word
However we know that firefox sounds like fire and fox put together. So let's just open the vocabulary (you can keep the wizard open) by selecting Vocabulary from your Simon main toolbar.
The import will ignore sentences where one or more words could not be found in the language model unless you tick the Also import unknown sentences check box in which case those words are replaced with Unknown.
Renaming Categories
The rename category wizard allows you to rename categories in both your active vocabulary your shadow dictionary and the grammar.
Merging Categories
The merge category wizard allows you to merge two categories into one new category in both your active vocabulary your shadow dictionary and the grammar.
Each Command has a name (which will trigger its invocation) an icon and more fields depending on the type of the plugin (see below).
Some command plugins might provide a configuration of the plugin itself (not the commands it contains). These configuration pages will be plugged directly into the action configuration dialog (below the General menu item) when you load the associated plugin.
Plugins that provide a graphical user interface (like for example the input number command plugin) can be configured by configuring Voice commands. You can for example change the associated word that will trigger the button but also change the displayed icon etc; If you remove all voice interface commands from a graphical element the element will be hidden automatically.
Voice interface commands are added just like normal commands through the command configuration.
Configure voice interface commands
While this is not as elegant as stating the complete number it is much more practical.
However many applications (like the great mouseless browsing firefox addon) rely on the user to input large numbers without too much time passing between the individual keystrokes (mouseless browsing for example will wait exactly 500ms per default before it considers the input of the number complete). So if you want to enter 52 you would first say Five (pause) Two. Because of the needed pause the application (like the mouseless browsing plugin) would consider the input of Five complete.
The input number plugin - when triggered - presents a calculator-like interface for inputting a number. The input can be corrected by saying Back. It features a decimal point accessible by saying Comma. When saying Ok the number will be typed out. As all the voice-input and the correction is handled by the plugin itself the application that finally receive the input will only get couple of milliseconds between the individual digits.
Input Number Plugin
While the input number plugin is active (the user currently inputs a number) all input that is not directed at the input number plugin (other commands etc;) will be rejected. Say Cancel at any time to abort the process.
Akonadi command configuration
The plugin fulfills two major purposes
Execute Simon commands at scheduled times
The Akonadi plugin can monitor a specific collection (calendar) and react on entries whose summary start with a specific prefix. Per default this prefix is "[simon-command]" meaning that events of the form "[simon-command] lt;plugin namegt;//lt;command namegt;" will trigger the appropriate kmyapplication; command at the "start time" of the event.
The name of the plugins and commands are equivalent to the ones shown in the command dialog and do not necessarily need to reference commands in the same scenario as the Akonadi plugin instance.
Their location depends on your operation system
Training data files
`kde4-config --install data`/ssc/texts/
The path for GNU/Linux uses an inline command to resolve the installation folder for you. You can also run kde4-config --install data in a shell to find out the exact path. On Microsoft Windows you have to fill in the installation folder for yourself. Usually this will be something like C\Program files\simon 0.3\ or similar.
The texts folder will contain three subfolders containing the prompts

KIO support
i18n-rekonq; browsing an FTP; share
i18n-rekonq; supports KIO services including cookies cache proxies and network settings. KIO-slaves like file/ ftp/ man/ help/ info/ etc; will work in i18n-rekonq; too.
In addition to all this i18n-rekonq; uses kde;'s own file dialog for opening/saving documents. This means you have access to the Places navigation panel from dolphin; while you open or save documents.
Thus i18n-rekonq; looks feels and behaves like a part of your kde; desktop.
underFDL;
How to obtain i18n-rekonq;
Stable Packages of i18n-rekonq; can be downloaded via standard repositories of your distribution
You also can compile i18n-rekonq; yourself see Compilation and Installation for that.
In order to successfully use i18n-rekonq; you need at least Qt; 4.8.x and kde; 4.8.4.
When creating your own latex; files inverse search can be very helpful. Once you have created a DVI; file (DeVice Independent File) or PDF file you can click the left mouse button while pressing Shift; in the viewer and kile; will jump to the corresponding line in the latex; source code.
A DVI; is a type of file containing a description of a formatted document along with other information including character font and is besides PDF the usual output of tex; or latex;. A number of utilities exist to view convert and print DVI; files on various systems and devices.
When using inverse search the selection of items in the DVI; or PDF file is associated with the editor so when you click on the DVI; or PDF file the main window jumps to the corresponding section of latex; code in the editor. Forward search is the exact opposite of this. Forward search will allow you to click on a specific section of text in the latex; code and jump to the associated position in the viewer window.
The Toolbar
New begin a new document.
Inverse search cannot work unless
The source file has been compiled successfully.
okular; knows which editor you would like to use.
With this feature of okular; a left mouse click while pressing Shift; in the DVI; or PDF document will result in kile; opening the corresponding latex; document and attempt to go to the corresponding line. Remember to tell okular; to use kile; as a text editor in okular;'s menu item SettingsConfigure Okular (on the page Editor).
Configuring okular;
Delete the current math group including the math commands.
Ctrl;Alt;T P Paragraph
Delete a whole paragraph. Look at the SelectParagraph command how a paragraph is defined in kile;.
Ctrl;Alt;T I To End of Line
Delete the text from the current cursor position to the end of the line.
Inserting a tabular environment
Using the toolbar on top of the dialog you can set the align of a cell define a certain font style join and split cells choose a border and specify background and font colors. On the extreme right there is a Paste button. With this button you can insert a table from the clipboard into the dialog which allows you to copy and paste tables from a spreadsheet program for example.
Below you can choose how many rows and columns you want and you can tweak some more details about your array
With the Name option you can select which environment should be used for your array or tabular material.
You can select the vertical cell alignment with the Parameter option. This is only enabled for environments which support that feature.
2 pages (landscape) --> A4
Put two consecutive pages in landscape mode together on one A4 page.
Combine two pages (in landscape mode)
4 pages --> A4
Combine four consecutive pages together on one A4 page. The pages have to be scaled to fit on the page.
Subdocument Mode
If you have a large project with a lot of documents compiling the whole project is not a great idea if you have made changes only in one single document. kile; is able to compile and show a preview of the current subdocument. It takes the preamble from the master document and only compiles the current part when you choose BuildQuickPreviewSubdocument or the keyboard shortcut Ctrl;Alt;PD.
Mathgroup Mode
The mathgroup preview mode allows you to preview the mathgroup you are currently editing. kile; takes the preamble from the master document and only compiles the mathgroup the cursor is currently in when you choose BuildQuickPreviewMathgroup or the keyboard shortcut Ctrl;Alt;PM.
Instead of showing the preview in a new document kile; can also be configured to use the bottom bar for preview compilations. You can activate this feature in the quick preview configuration panel.
The Files and Projects view is a button of the sidebar menu. From this view you can see the structure of your project its files and the name of the .kilepr file that stores the project information. Adding removing or changing options in your project is done via the Files and Projects view.
Adding and Removing Files
To add a file to your project open any tex; file right click on its name in the Files and Projects view and select Add to Project. If you have opened multiple projects a dialog box will pop up in which you can specify to which project the file should be added.
You can also right-click on the project's name in the Files and Projects view and select Add Files to bring up a file selection dialog.
Adding a file to a project
Scripting editor key sequence
This method can be extended to a rather sophisticated kind of code completion. Let us assume that you have a written a script which simply inserts the latex; command \textbf{} into the current document.
If you now type the assigned key sequence bfx in your text document this key sequence will be removed and the script will be executed. It will insert \textbf{} and the cursor is placed between the braces.
Scripting typing an editor key sequence
What a comfortable and powerful method of code completion.
Set the cursor column to the given column.
Cursor view.virtualCursorPosition();
Get the current virtual cursor position. Virtual means the tabulator character (TAB) counts multiple characters as configured by the user (e.g. one TAB is 8 spaces). The virtual cursor position provides access to the user visible values of the current cursor position.
bool view.hasSelection();
Returns true if the view has selected text otherwise false.
void document.previousBullet();
bool document.hasEnvironment();
Returns true if a surrounding latex; environment is found else false.
String document.environment(bool inside = false);
Returns the entire text of the surrounding latex; environment. If inside is false the environment text including the surrounding latex; tags \begin{}\end{} will be returned else without these tags. If no parameter is given inside is set to false. If no environment is found the returned string is empty.
void document.uppercase();
Put the selected text or the letter after the cursor in uppercase.
void document.lowercase();
Put the selected text or the letter after the cursor in lowercase.
void document.capitalize();
either the menu User Menu will appear in the main menu bar between the menus LaTeX and Wizard and the configuration wizard Edit User Menu in the Wizard menu
User Menu is placed in the main menu
or both items will appear at the bottom of the LaTeX menu.
User Menu as a part of the LaTeX menu
Already existing user-defined tags from older versions of kile; are automatically transformed into the new user-configurable menu. The tags are saved in a file called usertags.xml and like all menu definition files they can be found in the local user menu directory of kile; KILEAPPDIR/usermenu/ eg; /home/user/.kde/share/apps/kile/usermenu/.

State Diagrams show the different states of an Object during its life and the stimuli that cause the Object to change its state.
State Diagrams view Objects as state machines or finite automates that can be in one of a set of finite states and that can change its state via one of a finite set of stimuli. For example an Object of type NetServer can be in one of following states during its life
and the events that can cause the Object to change states are
Creating Diagrams
To create a new diagram in your model simply select the diagram type you need from the New submenu in the Diagram menu and give a name to it. The diagram will be created and made active and you will immediately see it in the tree view.
Remember that umbrello; makes extensive use of context menus you can also RMB; click on a folder in the Tree View and select the appropriate diagram type from the New submenu in the context menu. Note that you can create Use Case Diagrams only in Use Case View folders and the other types of diagram can only be created in the Logical View folders.
Removing Diagrams
Should you need to remove a diagram from your model you can do this by making it active and selecting Delete from the Diagram Menu. You can also achieve this by selecting Delete from the diagrams context menu in the Tree View

For the Font path directive to work as intended the application that wants to print needs to
Either correctly reference its desired fonts in the header of the generated PostScript;
Or embed the font into the PostScript; file.
Referencing the font by name leaves it up to the RIP and print device to respect and actually use it. RIP or printer can only use the desired font if it is available on the system.
Both Browse allow and Browse deny accept the following notations for addresses

will deny the usage of this same printer to the three mentioned users and at the same time allow it to all others. If denied user wants to print on the DigiMaster via this CUPS; server he will receive an error message along the lines client-error-not-possible.
Only one of the two options may be used at one time; at present there is no support to have a similar option in a per-group based way. This will be implemented in the future.
Imposing Quotas for certain printers
Sometimes you want to impose quotas for certain printers. With quotas you can set upper limits for the number of pages or the amount of data to be printed over a certain period to a certain printer.
Quotas can be set with the -o option when installing a printer with the lpadmin command or afterwards for an already existing printer. Following are some guidelines (which are missing at the time of writing in the official CUPS; documentation)
Final word from the Author
Who am I what is my business?
My employer is Danka Deutschland GmbH a leading and manufacturer-independent provider of professional and hi-speed digital printing systems black-and-white as well as color. Danka provides hardware software service maintenance consumables and customized solutions for the products in its portfolio. I work there as a System Engineer. Amongst the brands Danka offers are Heidelberg (formerly Kodak) Canon Hewlett-Packard; Hitachi Infotec and EfI.
My acquaintance with Linux; and the Free Software community is not too old. When I started to play around with Linux; at the beginning of 1999 my deepest disappointment was the poor support for printing. True I made all our machines spit out simplex prints -- but what about duplex? What about punching the output? How to make sorting work? Or stapling cover sheets and all the other beautiful finishing options our engines offer to customers? No way -- at least for me as a non-geek!
I began a search on the Internet for a solution. Fortunately not much later in May 1999 Mike Sweet principal developer of CUPS; announced the first Beta release of this superb piece of printing software. After trying it briefly I knew this was it!
Experienced kde; users may already be familiar with Michael's utilities qtcups and kups (co-developed with Jean-Eric Cuendet). These were up until now the graphical GUI; front ends for CUPS; with a strong relation to kde;.
qtcups and kups mdash; The Predecessors
Both utilities are probably still widely used. For those not familiar with them here are brief explanations.
qtcups was a graphical front end for the lp or lpr print commands as installed by CUPS;. Using qtcups opened a dialog. This dialog let you comfortably select your printer and the print job options. qtcups worked from the command line or from within applications when the application in question had a configurable print command.
kups was a graphical wrapper to do the administration tasks for your CUPS; server and the CUPS; daemon at the heart of it. You could add delete modify configure start and stop printers. You could cancel delete move stop and restart print jobs and you could change the settings of the daemon start stop and restart it.
Of course over time there came the development of other description methods. The most important competitors to PostScript; were PCL (Print Control Language from Hewlett-Packard;) ESC/P (from Epson) and GDI (Graphical Device Interface from Microsoft;).
The appearance of these page description languages made life easier and facilitated further development for everybody. Yet the fact that there still remained different incompatible and competing page description languages keeps life for users administrators developers and manufacturers difficult enough.
PostScript; in memory - Bitmaps on Paper
PostScript; is most heavily used in professional printing environments such as PrePress and printing service industries. In the UNIX; and Linux; domains PostScript; is the predominant standard as a PDL. Here nearly every program generates a PostScript; representation of its pages once you push the Print button. Let us look at a simple example of (hand-made) PostScript; code. The following listing describes two simple drawings

The RIGHTB() function returns a substring that contains the 'length' rightmost characters of the string using byte positions. The whole string is returned if 'length' exceeds the length of the string.
RIGHTB(text;ByteLength)
The LEFT() function returns a substring that contains the 'length' leftmost characters of the string. The whole string is returned if 'length' exceeds the length of the string. It is an error for the number of characters to be less than 0.
LEFT(text;length)
LEFT("hello";2) returns "he"

Use Custom Alpha Values
QtCurve uses dark/light borders to create etch and shadow effects. By default QtCurve tries to lighten (or darken) the parent's background to achieve this - if no parent can be found then white/black is used with an alpha value set. This behaviour may be overridden and alpha values always used by checking the option above.

Gnumch Factors
Guide the Number Muncher to all the factors of the number at the top of the screen.
Learn about multiples and factors.
The factors of a number are all the numbers that divide that number evenly. For example the factors of 6 are 1 2 3 and 6. 4 is not a factor of 6 because 6 cannot be divided into 4 equal pieces. If one number is a multiple of a second number then the second number is a factor of the first number. You can think of multiples as families and factors are the people in those families. So 1 2 3 and 6 all fit into the 6 family but 4 belongs to another family.

There are four ways to draw stars on the map.  By default stars are circles with a white core and a rim which is tinted to reflect the star's actual color.  You may also choose to draw the stars as solid white red or black circles to match the needs of your overall color scheme.

The profiles that end in '-g10.icc' are linear gamma (gamma=1.0 'linear light' etc) profiles and should only be used when editing at high bit depths (16-bit floating point 16-bit integer 32-bit floating point 32-bit integer). Many editing operations produce better results in linear gamma color spaces.
The profiles that end in '-labl.icc' have perceptually uniform TRCs. A few editing operations really should be done on perceptually uniform RGB. Make sure you use the V4 versions for editing high bit depth images.
The profiles that end in '-srgbtrc.icc' '-g22.icc' and '-bt709.icc' have approximately but not exactly perceptually uniform TRCs. ProPhotoRGB's gamma=1.8 TRC is not quite as close to being perceptually uniform.
When editing 8-bit images you should use a profile with a small color gamut and an approximately or exactly perceptually uniform TRC. Of the profiles supplied in my profile pack only the sRGB and AdobeRGB1998 (ClayRGB) color spaces are small enough for 8-bit editing. Even with the AdobeRGB1998 color space you need to be careful to not cause posterization. And of course you cannot use the linear gamma versions of these profiles for 8-bit editing.
Use V4 profiles for editing images using high bit depth image editors that use LCMS as the Color Management Module. This includes Krita digiKam/showFoto and GIMP 2.9.

ACBF Document Info
Whether the acbf file is an adaption of an existing source and if so how to find information about that source. So for example for an adapted webcomic the official website url should go here.
By default this will be filled with a generated universal unique identifier. The ID by itself is merely so that comic book library management programs can figure out if this particular comic is already in their database and whether it has been rated. Of course the UUID can be changed into something else by manually changing the JSON but this is advanced usage.

The bitrate is a measure of the quantity of data used to represent a second of the audio track.The MP3 encoder used by Amarok supports a variable bitrate (VBR) setting which means that the bitrate value fluctuates along the track based on the complexity of the audio content. More complex intervals of data are encoded with a higher bitrate than less complex ones; this approach yields overall better quality and a smaller file than having a constant bitrate throughout the track.For this reason the bitrate measure in this slider is just an estimate of the average bitrate of the encoded track.160kb/s is a good choice for music listening on a portable player.Anything below 120kb/s might be unsatisfactory for music and anything above 205kb/s is probably overkill.
Expected average bitrate for variable bitrate encoding
MPEG Audio Layer 3 (MP3) is a patented digital audio codec using a form of lossy data compression.In spite of its shortcomings it is a common format for consumer audio storage and is widely supported on portable music players.

Opus is a patent-free digital audio codec using a form of lossy data compression.
If checked append ' The' to the artists' names starting with 'The'.
If checked all artists starting with "The" will have it moved to the end. Example "The Beatles" would become "Beatles The"

Mouse This module allows you to choose various options for the way in which your pointing device works. Your pointing device may be a mouse trackball or some other hardware that performs a similar function.
If you are left-handed you may prefer to swap the functions of the left and right buttons on your pointing device by choosing the 'left-handed' option. If your pointing device has more than two buttons only those that function as the left and right buttons are affected. For example if you have a three-button mouse the middle button is unaffected.

Long Way Up
A Little Present To Say Goodbye
After some very hard levels maybe you would like an easy one. Goodbye!
This diagonal maze is not too hard except there is the occasional pit to get trapped in and that lone enemy is fast.  Try to lure the enemy down and into one of the pits.  Then the rest is almost a cake walk.
Dain
Duergar
A maze without walls or enemies - how hard can it be?  But the traps act as walls and the enemies would just fill the traps so perhaps this is another one where you will want to draw a map.  Note that you can probe for traps by digging but that can lead to a rather slow game while you wait for the bricks you dig to refill.

MP3 Audio Decoder plugin not found.
K3b could not load or find the MP3 decoder plugin. This means that you will not be able to create Audio CDs from MP3 files. Many Linux distributions do not include MP3 support for legal reasons.
To enable MP3 support please install the MAD MP3 decoding library as well as the K3b MAD MP3 decoder plugin (the latter may already be installed but not functional due to the missing libmad). Some distributions allow installation of MP3 support via an online update tool.
System locale charset is ANSIX3.4-1968
Your system's locale charset (i.e. the charset used to encode filenames) is set to ANSIX3.4-1968. It is highly unlikely that this has been done intentionally. Most likely the locale is not set at all. An invalid setting will result in problems when creating data projects.

Set the device to be used for new projects. (This option has no effect its main purpose is to enable handling of empty media from the KDE Media Manager.)
Each medium has an official maximum capacity which is stored in a read-only area of the medium and is guaranteed by the vendor. However this official maximum is not always the actual maximum. Many media have an actual total capacity that is slightly larger than the official amount.If this option is checked K3b will disable a safety check that prevents burning beyond the official capacity.Caution Enabling this option can cause failures in the end of the burning process if K3b attempts to write beyond the official capacity. It makes sense to first determine the actual maximum capacity of the media brand with a simulated burn.
If this option is checked K3b will automatically erase CD-RWs and format DVD-RWs if one is found instead of an empty media before writing.
If this option is checked K3b will not eject the medium once the burn process finishes. This can be helpful in case one leaves the computer after starting the burning and does not want the tray to be open all the time.However on Linux systems a freshly burned medium has to be reloaded. Otherwise the system will not detect the changes and still treat it as an empty medium.
If this option is checked K3b will continue in some situations which would otherwise be deemed as unsafe.This setting for example disables the check for medium speed verification. Thus one can force K3b to burn a high speed medium on a low speed writer.Caution Enabling this option may result in damaged media.

List of all CallersThis list shows all functions calling the current selected one either directly or with several functions in-between on the stack; the number of functions in-between plus one is called the Distance (e.g. for function ABC there exists a call from A to C when A calls B and B calls C i.e. A => B => C. The distance here is 2).Absolute cost shown is the cost spent in the selected function while a listed function is active; relative cost is the percentage of all cost spent in the selected function while the listed one is active. The cost graphic shows logarithmic percentage with a different color for each distance.As there can be many calls from the same function the distance column sometimes shows the range of distances for all calls happening; then in parentheses there is the medium distance i.e. the distance where most of the call costs happened.Selecting a function makes it the current selected one of this information panel. If there are two panels (Split mode) the function of the other panel is changed instead.

If your scanner has not been automatically detected you can specify it here. The Scanner device name should be a backend name (with optional parameters) that is understood by SANE see sane(7) or sane-dll(5) for more information on available backends. The Type and Description can be used to identify the scanner later.For the information that needs to be entered here try to locate the device using the sane-find-scanner(1) command. For a USB or networked HP scanner using HPLIP try using the hp-probe command to locate it for example hp-probenbsp;-bnbsp;usb or hp-probenbsp;-bnbsp;net. If the scanner is found then enter the device name displayed by these commands; note that if using HPLIP then hp needs to be replaced by hpaio.If these commands fail to locate your scanner then it may not be supported by SANE.

Git is a software tool used to manage large projects collaboratively. WikiToLearn uses Git to manage the updates and all the changes of the project.
First of all you will have to '''[https//git-scm.com/ install Git]'''. If you are not familiar on how to use it you could start with this '''[https//try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1 15 minutes tutorial]'''. A full git tutorial is provided by '''[https//www.atlassian.com/git/ Atlassian]''' or you can also try the '''[https//www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git codeacademy guide]''' (extremely simple).
We also suggest you this '''[http//ktown.kde.org/zrusin/git/git-cheat-sheet.svg cheat sheet]''' with the most used commands.
Docker is a software used by WikiToLearn to divide the project into different modules. To run WikiToLearn you will need to '''[https//docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/ install and get started with Docker]'''.

The Back and Forward buttons in the toolbar can be used to navigate in the history.
If you click with the MMB; the item in the history is opened in a new tab thus keeping the current tab with its content.
If the kompare; application is installed you can use it to see the differences between two files or folders.
First select the two files or folders to be compared. Then launch the kompare; application via the Tools menu  Tools Compare Files . kompare; will then open showing the differences between the files or folders.
Filtering Files
dolphin; is capable of filtering files ie; showing only those items in the view whose name contains a given text. For example if you wish to show only the MP3 files within a folder you could filter for .mp3. This would then filter out all files whose name does not contain .mp3.
To filter files first enable the filter bar either by pressing Ctrl;I or via the menu  Tools Show Filter Bar . You can then enter the text to be filtered for in the filter bar. The filter bar can be disabled either by pressing Esc; or with a LMB; click on the Hide Filter Bar icon.
You will find an explanation of all available objects in konqueror;'s handbook in the chapter Create New.

katepart; is a fully featured editor component by kde;.
KatePart
katepart; is a fully featured text editor component used by many Qt; and kde; applications. katepart; is more than a text editor; it is meant to be a programmer's editor and could be considered as at least a partial alternative to more powerful editors. One of katepart;'s main features is the colorized syntax customized for many different programming languages such as C/C++ Java; Python Perl Bash Modula 2 HTML; and Ada.
kwrite; is a simple text editor application based on katepart;. It has a single document interface (SDI) allowing you to edit one file at the time per window. Since kwrite; is a very simple implementation of katepart; it does not require its own documentation. If you know how to use kwrite; you can use katepart; anywhere!
The month as number with a leading zero (01-12).
MMMM
The long localized month name (e.g. 'January'..'December').
MMM
The abbreviated localized month name (e.g. 'Jan'..'Dec').
Code folding allows you to hide parts of a document in the editor making it easier to overview large documents. In kappname; the foldable regions are calculated using rules defined in the syntax highlight definitions and therefore it is only available in some formats - typically program source code XML markup and similar. Most highlight definitions supporting code folding also lets you manually define foldable regions typically using the BEGIN and END keywords.
To use the code folding feature activate the folding markers using ViewShow Folding Markers menu item if they are not already visible. The Folding Markers Pane on the left side of the screen displays a graphical view of the foldable regions with triangle symbols to indicate the possible operation on a given region a top down triangle means that the region is expanded clicking it will collapse the region and a right pointing triangle will be displayed instead.
Three commands are provided to manipulate the state of folding regions see the menu documentation.
The folded lines are remembered when a file is closed so when you reopen the file the folded nodes will still be folded. This applies to reload operations as well.
If you do not want to use the code folding feature you can disable the Show folding markers (if available) option in the Appearance page of the editor configuration.
If this option is selected the Tab; key always indents the current line by the number of character positions specified in Indentation width.
If this option is selected the Tab; key either indents the current line or advances to the next tab position. If the insertion point is at or before the first non-space character in the line or if there is a selection the current line is indented by the number of character positions specified in Indentation width. If the insertion point is located after the first non-space character in the line and there is no selection white space is inserted so that the next tab position is reached if the option Insert spaces instead of tabulators on the General tab in the Editing page is enabled spaces are inserted; otherwise a single tabulator is inserted.
If enabled a word completion box automatically pops up during typing showing a list of text entries to complete the current text under the cursor.
While typing text the word completion searches for words in the document starting with the already typed text. This option configures the minimal amount of characters that are needed to make the word completion active and pop up a completion box.
Remove the tail of a previous word when the completion item is chosen from a list.
Set the indentation width.
keep-extra-spacesBOOL
Set whether to keep extra spaces when calculating indentation width.
line-numbersBOOL
Set the display of line numbers on or off.
casesensitive defines whether the keywords are case sensitive or not.
priority is necessary if another highlight definition file uses the same extensions. The higher priority will win.
author contains the name of the author and his email-address.
license contains the license usually the MIT license for new syntax-highlighting files.
style contains the provided language and is used by the indenters for the attribute required-syntax-style.
attribute An attribute maps to a defined itemData.
context Specify the context to which the highlighting system switches if the rule matches.
beginRegion Start a code folding block. Default unset.
endRegion Close a code folding block. Default unset.
lookAhead If true the highlighting system will not process the matches length. Default false.
Look into other XML-files to see how other people implement tricky rules.
You can validate every XML file by using the command validatehl.sh language.xsd mySyntax.xml. The files validatehl.sh and language.xsd are available in Syntax Highlighting repository.
If you repeat complex regular expression very often you can use ENTITIES. Example
Now you can use amp;myref; instead of the regular expression.
The kappname; editor component is easily extensible by writing scripts. The scripting language is ECMAScript (widely known as JavaScript). kappname; supports two kinds of scripts indentation and command line scripts.
String document.highlightingModeAt(Cursor pos);
Returns the highlighting mode used at the given position in the document.
Array document.embeddedHighlightingModes();

If checked the search and replace will be performed within the selected text only.
Find all
Clicking this button highlights all matches in the document and shows the number of found matches in a small popup.
Finding Text
To find text launch the incremental search bar with Ctrl;F or from the Edit Find menu item.
\w
Matches any word character - in this case any letter or digit. Note that underscore () is not matched as is the case with perl regular expressions. Equal to [a-zA-Z0-9]
\W
Matches any non-word character - anything but letters or numbers. Equal to [^a-zA-Z0-9] or [^\w]
The abbreviated classes can be put inside a custom class for example to match a word character a blank or a dot you could write [\w \.]
The expression handy(?=\w) will match at handy in handyman but not in That came in handy!
(?!PATTERN) (Negative lookahead)
The negative lookahead prevents a possible match to be acknowledged if the following part of the searched string does match its PATTERN.
The expression const \w+\b(?!\s*amp;) will match at const char in the string const char* foo while it can not match const QString in const QStringamp; bar because the amp; matches the negative lookahead assertion pattern.

Bookmarks home page
This module lets you configure the bookmarks home page.
To view the bookmarks home page enter bookmarks/ in the location bar.
On this page you find settings for home and start page and the behavior of tabbed browsing both for konqueror;'s file manager and browser mode.
This option determines which page is displayed when konqueror; starts the introduction page your home page a blank page or your bookmarks page.
This is the URL; (eg; a folder or a web page) where konqueror; in browser mode will jump to when the Home Page button in the toolbar is pressed. You can set a path that is your Home page by typing into the text field or using the browse icon to select a local folder. konqueror; needs to be restarted for changes to take effect.
When konqueror; is used in file manager mode the Home Page button in the toolbar is replaced by a Home Folder button which makes it jump to your local home folder instead.
konqueror; defaults to a single window per page but has the capability to open multiple tabs inside a single window. konqueror; also by default has a MMB; shortcut to open any link in a new window. If you enable Open links in new tab instead of in new window you can MMB; click on a link to have it open in a new tab.
Here you can refine your search. These are the special refinements you can choose
Here you can either enter two dates between which the files were created or modified or specify a time period.
Here you can specify if the file has to be at least or at most as big as the size you entered in the following box or else equal to the size.
Files owned by user Files owned by group
Here you can specify user and group names as owner of the files.
In the left hand pane you will see a tree view with two choices Alphabetically or By Topic. Both contain the same entries sorted differently to allow you to quickly find the item of interest.
Navigate down the tree views to the left and items you select will be displayed on the right.
The menus and toolbar
khelpcenter; has a very minimal interface allowing you to concentrate on getting help rather than learning how to use the help browser.
The icons available to you in the toolbar are as follows
If you have enabled the Right click goes back in history option in konqueror;'s  configuration settings a simple right click is equivalent to clicking on the Back button. In this case you can access the context menu by moving the mouse with the right button held down.
On the Titlebar
Right clicking on any free area of the Titlebar brings up the Titlebar Menu allowing you to control the position of konqueror;'s window as well as the decoration applied to all kde; program windows.
On the Main Toolbar
Right click on any free area of the Toolbar to bring up the Toolbar Menu. You can also use the Toolbar Menu to set the size of the buttons on the Toolbar and whether they are shown as icons text or both.
If you have copied multiple items Skip the current item.
The Apply to All button can be used if you have copied multiple items.
If Show selection marker is enabled in the Behavior tab of the File Management General section of the settings a small + or - button appears in the top left corner of the item which is currently hovered over with the mouse. Clicking this sign selects or deselects the item respectively.
If an arrow key PgUp PgDn Home or End is pressed the new current item is selected and the previous selection is cleared.
Selecting Items Using the Menu
But if what you really want is that glorious picture of the latest Ferrari then right clicking on the image will give you a drop-down menu with a Save Image As option. Be sure to respect the owner's copyright and ask for permission before using any pictures saved this way for anything other than your own viewing pleasure.
If you right click on a link (which may be a picture) and select Save Link As from the pop up menu the basic HTML; or similar source text will be downloaded and saved on your local disk.
Right clicking on a link (which may be a picture) and choosing Copy Link Address will copy the URL; of the link to the clipboard so you can then paste it into say an e-mail to a friend telling her about this wonderful new site.
Right clicking on a picture and choosing Copy Image copies the URL; of the picture to the clipboard.
To save a complete web page including images select  Archive Web Page from the Tools menu. Note that this feature is provided by a plugin  and may not have been installed on your system. The web page will be saved as a single file with a .war extension and can be opened by left clicking on the filename in konqueror; running in File Manager mode.

The Normal Screen buffer (default) allows you to scroll back to view previous lines of output this is the default buffer you usually use to execute commands etc;
The Alternate Screen buffer the terminal switches to this buffer when you run an interactive program (eg; less vim screen tmux etc;)
KeyPad
If this mode is set the key combination uses a key on the Keypad (Number Pad). This mode is useful to distinguish between keys on the keyboard and keys on the Keypad. For example when Num Lock is on you can configure two separate key combinations one using the key labelled 1 on the keyboard (usually under the F1 key) and the other using the key labelled 1 on the Keypad. The same concept applies when Num Lock is off for the End Home Cursor Keys etc on the Keypad

On this page you can find different ways to find online help and additional information provided by the KDE community.
The term kexi; project or simply project is also used to refer to a kexi; database regardless of whether it is stored in a file or on a database server.
kexi; database files usually have the extension .kexi
Creating a New Database File
Run kexi; or if it is already running use KexiNew (Ctrl+N).
On the New Project page under Blank Projects section choose Blank Database.
First there will be two tables added to your database Persons and Phones. These are exactly the same tables as described in chapter Database and Spreadsheet. A layout for Persons can be found in section Data integrity and validity in that chapter.
Select Table from the toolbar. You can also use Create object table in the context menu of the Tables item in the Project Navigator.
The Table Designer's window will appear. Looking at the top of designer's window you will notice that kexi; proposed you a generic name like Table1 for the new table. The table design is not saved yet so you will be able to assign more proper name later. Moreover because of the same reason the table name is not yet visible in the Project Navigator.
The Table Designer window
Table Designer window consists of following columns
Click on the form surface with the left mouse button. A new text box widget will be placed in the point where you clicked. Before you release you can drag your mouse to specify a desired size for the widget.
If needed move the inserted widget using drag amp; drop to a desired position. You can resize the widget afterwards by dragging one of the small boxes appearing near its corners. Note that the boxes are only visible when the widget is selected. If you select another widget or the form surface the boxes disappear.
Click the Text Box toolbar button again and click on the form surface to insert another widget. Repeat this action once again until you get three more text boxes inserted in your form. For the sake of simplicity we will limit ourselves to five data fields.
There is a context menu available in form's design mode activated by a right mouse button click the desired widget or the form's surface. The menu offers commands like Cut Copy Paste Delete and other more complex. Keyboard shortcuts are also available for these commands. Some of the commands are only available for certain types of widgets.
The commands Cut Copy and Paste makes it possible to move or copy widgets between forms even between separate database projects.
From the Create tab you can create objects that will be added to your project.
Selecting Table will take you to the table designer at the design view to allow you to add field definitions to your table.
Selecting Query will take you to the query designer at the design view to allow you to design a query to get custom results from your tables in your project.
Selecting Form will take you to the form designer at the design view to allow you to add widgets to your form.
Selecting Report will take you to the report designer at the design view to allow you to add widgets to your report.
Data integrity and validity
Note the way data is entered in the fields Name and surname and Address. People entering data can be fallible sometimes even negligent. In our sample data we have both different sequence of entering name and surname (Joan Smith and Smith Joan; Adam and ADAM) and many more ways of entering the same address. Surely you can think of many other ways.
The above problem shows that eg; when searching the telephone number of a person whose address is Western Gate 1 Warsaw you will not get a full result. You will get only one row instead of three. Moreover You will also not find all the telephone numbers searching for the value Joan Smith in the field Name and surname because Smith Joan will not fit to Joan Smith.
How can you solve these problems using a database? You can do this by changing the design of the table Persons by
Dividing data in the field Name and surname into two separate fields Name and Surname.

Inserting External Data
You can insert data from a text file or from the clipboard into a worksheet by first selecting the cell where you want the top left item of the inserted data to appear then choosing From Text File or From Clipboard from the InsertExternal Data  sub menu.
In both cases sheets; will assume that the data is in CSV form and will open a dialog box allowing you to control how the data is extracted from the file or clipboard and placed into the worksheet cells.
If support for it has been included in your system sheets; can also insert data from a SQL database into a worksheet. This is done by using the Insert External DataFrom Database  option.
You could enter a similar formula into cell C7 except that in this case it would have to be =C2+C3+C4+C5 but there is an easier way which is to Copy cell B7 and Paste it into C7. sheets; will automatically adjust the cell references from B.. to C.. when the Paste is done.
At this point you may think that sheets; is doing no more than you could manage with pencil paper and a calculator and you could be right but remember that this is a very small example of a spreadsheet doing simple calculations on only a few numbers. For any reasonably amount of values or data using a spreadsheet to do the calculations is much quicker and more accurate than doing them manually.
Also a spreadsheet lets you play the What if? game. Because each formula is automatically recalculated whenever any of the values it refers to are changed you can quickly see what happens if you alter any of them. Using our example you can see the effect of reducing the amount spent on food in December by just entering a new value into cell C2. If you had a spreadsheet that modelled the greenhouse effect accurately you could perhaps see the effect of a 50 percent reduction in the amount of methane released into the atmosphere.
Selecting Cells
You can select a single cell or a rectangular area of cells in the spreadsheet. The selected cell(s) are displayed with a thick black border.
File Save As
Save and change the current document to a new name or format. If you want to keep the name and format of the document use Export
File Reload

Tools Protect Sheet
Protect the sheet with a password. A dialog pops up prompting you for a password. Unchecking this option will prompt you for the password in order to unprotect the sheet. Protecting a sheet means protecting all cells in the sheet. In a protected sheet the cells cannot be reformatted or overwritten.
Controls the maximum number of filenames that are shown when you select File Open Recent.

The Menu and Toolbar Items
stage; presents different types of interfaces for you to interact with the program. Perhaps the most familiar type of interface is the menu which appears on the top of the stage; window.
Clicking on the menu items gives you a list of commands from which you can choose the one you want. Many of the commands can also be accessed directly by holding down Ctrl; or Alt; and pressing another key on your keyboard. In the next section each of the menu commands is described in brief.

The Altitude vs. Time Tool
Altitude vs. Time Plotter
This tool plots the altitude of any objects as a function of time for any date and location on Earth. The top section is a graphical plot of altitude angle on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis. The time is shown both as standard local time along the bottom and sidereal time along the top. The bottom half of the graph is shaded green to indicate that points in this region are below the horizon.
There are a few ways to add curves to the plot. The simplest way to add the curve of an existing object is to simply type its name in the Name input field and press Enter or the Plot button. If the text you enter is found in the object database the object's curve is added to the graph. You can also press the Find Object button to open the Find Object Window to select an object from the list of known objects. If you want to add a point that does not exist in the object database simply enter a name for the point and then fill in the coordinates in the RA and Dec input fields. Then press the Plot button to add the curve for your custom object to the plot (note that you have to pick a name that does not already exist in the object database for this to work).
When you add an object to the plot its altitude vs. time curve is plotted with a thick white line and its name is added to the listbox at the lower right. Any objects that were already present are plotted with a thinner red curve. You can choose which object is plotted with the thick white curve by highlighting its name in the listbox.

Sharpless HII region Catalog is the Sharpless (Sh2) catalog of HII regions (diffuse nebulae).
Hickson Compact Groups is a catalog consisting of 99 compact groups of galaxies.
Tycho-2 Star Catalog is a catalog of more than 2.5 million of the brightest stars. It contains stars with a magnitude value from 8.0 to 12.5.
USNO NOMAD Catalog is a catalog of about 100 million stars with magnitude from 12.5 to 16.5. Note that is requires Tycho-2 to be installed.
The following is a summary of catalogs in KStars
Satellites Window
The Satellites page allows you to set the satellites view options. Firstly you can see or hide the satellites on the skymap using Show satellites checkbox from the top View options section. By default satellites are drawn as small light red filled circles with an optional dark red name label next to them. You can enable or disable these labels by checking or not the Show labels checkbox. It is located below the Show satellites checkbox within the View options section.
The colors of the dots representing satellites and their name labels can be easily customized using the Colors page from the same Configure kstars; window. In addition satellites can be drawn just like regular stars by checking the Draw satellites like stars checkbox. To display only the visible satellites from your current geographic location and time select Show only visible satellites.
kstars; can draw artificial satellites from many predefined groups. Thus you can select to display a particular group multiple groups or partially select subgroups. Under each group a list of individual satellites is presented. To select all satellites from a group you need to check the group checkbox. You can also select only the satellites of interest in each group. The satellites orbital elements can be updated via the internet by pressing the Update TLEs button. Another way for updating the satellites orbital elements is to use the  UpdatesUpdate satellites orbital elements in the Data menu. If you know the name of a desired satellite then you can use the search satellites method that kstars; provides. You need to enter the name of satellite in the Search satellites text box and the list will be reduced only to its best matches.
You can add new satellites to kstars; default satellites set by editing the kstars/data/satellites.dat file. As each line of this file is a group of satellites you need to add a new entry for your desired satellites group. An entry should have the following format Group Name;localfilename;url. For example Iridium;iridium.tle;http//celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/iridium.txt.
The celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of gigantic radius centered on the Earth. All objects which can be seen in the sky can be thought of as lying on the surface of this sphere.
Of course we know that the objects in the sky are not on the surface of a sphere centered on the Earth so why bother with such a construct? Everything we see in the sky is so very far away that their distances are impossible to gauge just by looking at them. Since their distances are indeterminate you only need to know the direction toward the object to locate it in the sky. In this sense the celestial sphere model is a very practical model for mapping the sky.
The directions toward various objects in the sky can be quantified by constructing a Celestial Coordinate System.
The term given this missing mass is Dark Matter and those two words pretty well sum up everything we know about it at this point. We know there is Matter because we can see the effects of its gravitational influence. However the matter emits no detectable electromagnetic radiation at all hence it is Dark. There exist several theories to account for the missing mass ranging from exotic subatomic particles to a population of isolated black holes to less exotic brown and white dwarfs. The term missing mass might be misleading since the mass itself is not missing just its light. But what is exactly dark matter and how do we really know it exists if we cannot see it?
The story began in 1933 when Astronomer Fritz Zwicky was studying the motions of distant and massive clusters of galaxies specifically the Coma cluster and the Virgo cluster. Zwicky estimated the mass of each galaxy in the cluster based on their luminosity and added up all of the galaxy masses to get a total cluster mass. He then made a second independent estimate of the cluster mass based on measuring the spread in velocities of the individual galaxies in the cluster. To his suprise this second dynamical mass estimate was 400 times larger than the estimate based on the galaxy light.
kstars; is pretty accurate but it is not (yet) as precise as it can possibly be. The problem with high-precision calculations is that you start having to deal with a large number of complicating factors. If you are not a professional astronomer you will probably never have a problem with its accuracy or precision.
Here is a list of some of the complicating factors which limit the program's precision
Planet positions are only accurate for dates within 4000 years or so of the current epoch. The planet positions are predicted using a Fourier-like analysis of their orbits as observed over the past few centuries. We learnt in school that planets follow simple elliptical orbits around the Sun but this is not strictly true. It would be true only if there was only one planet in the Solar system and if the Sun and the planet were both point masses. As it is the planets are constantly tugging on each other perturbing the orbits slightly and tidal effects also induce precessional wobbling. In fact recent analysis suggests that the planets' orbits may not even be stable in the long term (i.e. millions or billions of years). As a rule of thumb you can expect the position of a planet to be accurate to a few arcseconds between the dates -2000 and 6000.
Pluto is the exception to this; its position is perhaps ten times less precise than the positions of the other planets. Still for dates near the present epoch its position can be trusted to about an arcsecond.
The moon's position is the most difficult to predict to high precision. This is because its motion is quite perturbed by the Earth. Also since it is so nearby even minute effects that would be undetectable in more distant bodies are easily apparent in the moon.
Controlling devices from sky map
INDI Control Panel The panel offers the user with all the features supported by a device.
The panel is divided into three main sections
Device tabs Each additional active device occupies a tab in the INDI panel. Multiple devices can run simultaneously without affecting the operation of other devices.
Property views on the Main Control and Options tabs Properties are the key element in INDI architecture. Each device defines a set of properties to communicate with the client. The current position of the telescope is an example of a property. Semantically similar properties are usually contained in logical blocks or groupings.
Set the correct port in the INDI Control Panel under the Devices menu. The default device is /dev/ttyS0
Restart kstars; and retry again.
kstars; reports that the telescope is online and ready but I cannot find the telescope's crosshair where is it?
kstars; retrieves the telescopes RA and DEC coordinates upon connection. If your alignment was performed correctly then you should see the crosshair around your target in the Sky Map. However the RA and DEC coordinates provided by the telescope may be incorrect (even below the horizon) and you need to Sync your telescope to your current target. You can use the right-click menu to center and track the telescope crosshair in the sky map.
The telescope is moving erratically or not moving at all. What can I do?
You can choose the date for the observation and the place you are going to observe from.
You can choose the treshold of magnitude for the objects to be shown. In astronomy absolute magnitude (also known as absolute visual magnitude when measured in the standard V photometric band) measures a celestial objectapos;s intrinsic brightness.
You can save your observation plan. And it will save it with a .obslist extension.
You can also access the WUT (Whatapos;s up tonight) which could be of a great assistance to you. It can give you ideas what to observe on a date time and place that you specify using the configuration buttons int the top-right corner of the Whatapos;s up tonight window.
This is how the Execution Session Window look. It can be opened by pressing Ctrl;2. In it you can also see some information about the selected object and you are able to add observing notes.
However there is a problem with Solar Time. The Earth does not actually spin around 360 degrees in one Solar Day. The Earth is in orbit around the Sun and over the course of one day it moves about one Degree along its orbit (360 degrees/365.25 Days for a full orbit = about one Degree per Day). So in 24 hours the direction toward the Sun changes by about a Degree. Therefore the Earth has to spin 361 degrees to make the Sun look like it has traveled 360 degrees around the Sky.
In astronomy we are concerned with how long it takes the Earth to spin with respect to the fixed stars not the Sun. So we would like a timescale that removes the complication of Earth's orbit around the Sun and just focuses on how long it takes the Earth to spin 360 degrees with respect to the stars. This rotational period is called a Sidereal Day. On average it is 4 minutes shorter than a Solar Day because of the extra 1 degree the Earth spins in a Solar Day. Rather than defining a Sidereal Day to be 23 hours 56 minutes we define Sidereal Hours Minutes and Seconds that are the same fraction of a Day as their Solar counterparts. Therefore one Solar Second = 1.00278 Sidereal Seconds.
The Sidereal Time is useful for determining where the stars are at any given time. Sidereal Time divides one full spin of the Earth into 24 Sidereal Hours; similarly the map of the sky is divided into 24 Hours of Right Ascension. This is no coincidence; Local Sidereal Time (LST) indicates the Right Ascension on the sky that is currently crossing the Local Meridian. So if a star has a Right Ascension of 05h 32m 24s it will be on your meridian at LST=053224. More generally the difference between an object's RA and the Local Sidereal Time tells you how far from the Meridian the object is. For example the same object at LST=063224 (one Sidereal Hour later) will be one Hour of Right Ascension west of your meridian which is 15 degrees. This angular distance from the meridian is called the object's Hour Angle.
The Local Sidereal Time is displayed by kstars; in the Time Info Box with the label ST (you have to unshade the box by double-clicking it in order to see the sidereal time). Note that the changing sidereal seconds are not synchronized with the changing Local Time and Universal Time seconds. In fact if you watch the clocks for a while you will notice that the Sidereal seconds really are slightly shorter than the LT and UT seconds.
Point to the Zenith (press Z or select Zenith from the Location menu). The Zenith is the point on the sky where you are looking straight up from the ground and it is a point on your Local Meridian. Note the Right Ascension of the Zenith it is exactly the same as your Local Sidereal Time.
The WUT tool also displays a short almanac of data for the selected date the rise and set times for the Sun and moon the duration of the night and the Moon's illumination fraction.
Below the almanac is where the object information is displayed. The objects are organized into type categories. Select an object type in the box labeled Select a Category and all objects of that type which are above the horizon on the selected night will be displayed in the box labeled Matching Objects. For example in the screenshot the Planets category has been selected and three planets which are up on the selected night are displayed (Mars Jupiter and Saturn). When an object in the list is selected its rise set and transit times are displayed in the lower-right panel (ie; Mars rises at 1713 transits at 2146 and sets at 0216). In addition you can press the Object Details button to open the Object Details window for that object.
By default the WUT will display objects which are above the horizon between sunset and midnight (ie; in the evening). You can choose to show objects which are up between midnight and dawn (in the morning) or between dusk and dawn (any time tonight) using the combobox near the top of the window. You can also choose to see only those objects that are brighter than a magnitude by setting a minimum magnitude using the Show objects brighter than magnitude spinbox. You may center the selected object in the Sky Map or add it to Wish List by pressing the Center Object or Add to List button.
The Zenith is the point in the sky where you are looking when you look straight up from the ground. More precisely it is the point on the sky with an Altitude of +90 Degrees; it is the Pole of the Horizontal Coordinate System. Geometrically it is the point on the Celestial Sphere intersected by a line drawn from the center of the Earth through your location on the Earth's surface.
The Zenith is by definition a point along the Local Meridian.
In knights; to castle you move the king two squares towards the rook. knights; will complete the castling move. Do not move the rook as knights; assumes you wish only to move the rook and not to castle.
When a pawn has reached the other end of the board it cannot move further since it always must move forward and not backwards. The pawn is then turned (promoted) into a queen rook bishop or knight. This promotion occurs as part of the move. Usually the piece chosen is the queen often called queening. The other pieces are sometimes chosen when their movements will aid in checkmate often called under promoting. The pawn can be turned into a piece even if that type of piece is still on the board. Thus you can have two queens or three rooks bishops or knights in play at once.
Game Endings
When a king is under attack and threatened with capture by an opponent's piece the king is said to be in check. A king must get out of check immediately. There are three possible ways to get out of check.
Capture the attacking piece.
Fifth above I have used the words translate and translation as a descriptive metaphor for what lcms does when it translates RGB values from one color space to another via the PCS. The usual and correct terminology is convert and conversion which I will use below. The four methods of conversion from one color space to another are perceptual relative colorimetric absolute colorimetric and saturation. Which method of conversion you should use for any given image processing step from raw file to final output image is beyond the scope of this tutorial. The standard advice is when in doubt use perceptual.
Sixth (and again strictly for future reference) assign a profile means change the meaning of the RGB numbers in an image by embedding a new profile without changing the actual RGB numbers associated with each pixel in the image; convert means embed a new profile but also change the RGB numbers at the same time so that the meaning of the RGB values - that is the real-world visible color represented by the trio of RGB numbers associated with each pixel in an image - remains the same before and after the conversion from one space to another. You should be able to do multiple conversions of an image from one working space to another and with a properly color-managed image editor even though all the RGB numbers in the image will change with each conversion the image on your screen should look the same (leaving aside the usually unnoticeable small but inevitable changes from accumulated gamut mismatches and mathematical rounding errors). However every time you assign a new working space profile rather than convert to a new working space the appearance of the image should more or less drastically change (usually for the worse).
Finally (and this is a crucially important point) color management is NOT only relevant if you shoot raw. Color management affects every stage of the image processing pipeline whether you start with a raw file that you yourself interpolate and translate into a tiff or if you start with a jpeg or tiff produced by your camera.
Copyrighted and copyleft working spaces
I will take it as given that ALL the ordinarily encountered working spaces such as
How can a color profile point to a real color in the real world?
Real people don't even see the same colors when they look at the world do they?
A long time ago (1931 although refinements continue to be made) the International Color Consortium decided to map out and mathematically describe all the colors visible to real people in the real world. So they showed a whole bunch of people a whole bunch of colors and asked them to say when "this" color matched "that" color where the two visually matching colors were in fact produced by differing combinations of wavelengths. What was the value of such a strange procedure? Human color perception depends on the fact that we have three types of cone receptors with peak sensitivity to light at wavelengths of approximately 430 540 and 570 nm but with considerable overlap in sensitivity between the different cone types. One consequence of how we see color is that many different combinations of differing wavelengths of light will look like "the same color".
After extensive testing the ICC produced the CIE-XYZ color space which mathematically describes and models all the colors visible to an ideal human observer ("ideal" in the sense of modeling the tested responses of lots of individual humans). This color space is NOT a color profile in the normal sense of the word. Rather it provides an absolute "Profile Connecting Space" (PCS) for translating color RGB values from one color space to another. (See here and here.)
CIE-XYZ is not the only PCS. Another commonly used PCS is CIE-Lab which is mathematically derived from the CIE-XYZ space. CIE-Lab is intended to be "perceptually uniform" meaning "a change of the same amount in a color value should produce a change of about the same visual importance" (cited from Wikipedia article). Wikipedia says "The three coordinates of CIELAB represent the lightness of the color (L* = 0 yields black and L* = 100 indicates diffuse white; specular white may be higher) its position between red/magenta and green (a* negative values indicate green while positive values indicate magenta) and its position between yellow and blue (b* negative values indicate blue and positive values indicate yellow)" (cited from Wikipedia article).
But keeping all the possible colors comes at a price as explained below. And it seems that any given digital image likely only contains a small subset of all the possible visible colors that your camera is capable of capturing. This small subset is easily contained in one of the smaller working spaces (an exception requiring a larger color gamut would be a picture of a highly saturated object such as yellow daffodil).
Using a very large working space means that editing your image (applying curves increasing saturation etc;) can easily produce colors that your eventual output device (printer monitor) simply cannot reproduce (you cannot see these colors while you're editing either). So the conversion from your working space to your output device space (say your printer) will have to remap the out-of-gamut colors in your edited image some of which might even be totally imaginary to your printer color space with its much smaller color gamut. This remapping process will lead to inaccurate colors and loss of saturation at best. Even worse the remapping can easily lead to banding (posterization - gaps in what should be a smooth color transition say across an expanse of blue sky) and clipping (eg; your carefully crafted muted transitions across delicate shades of red for example might get remapped to a solid block of dull red after conversion to your printer's color space). Also the experts say that 8-bit images just don't have enough tones to stretch across a wide gamut working space without banding and loss of saturation even before conversion to an output space. So if you choose a large gamut working space make sure you start with a 16-bit image.
To summarize large gamut working spaces improperly handled can lead to lost information on output. Small gamut working spaces can clip information on input. Medium-sized gamut working spaces try to strike a happy medium. Like Wikipedia says it's a trade-off.
Here are some oft-repeated bits of advice on choosing a working space
For images intended for the web use (or at least convert the final image to) sRGB.

The digikam; Apply Texture is a tool for applying decorative textures to an image.
By adding texture to your image whether color or black and white you can make it look like an oil painting on canvas an Old Masters etching a Pop Art portrait composed of enlarged half-tone dots or even a mural on a brick wall. The Decorate Apply Texture Image Editor menu can be used for that.

Improve Photos exposure with Local Contrast Tool
There are multiple ways to render HDR image to improve photos containing under or overexposed areas. With camera devices usual tools let you merge multiple shots with different exposures into one perfectly exposed photo. This work nicely but require some limitation as for example the necessity to shot static subjects. But what if you have just in case of single image or with dynamic subjects? You might want to give a try to the Local Contrast feature. It‚Äôs based on the LDR Tonemapping utility which is designed to improve the dynamic range of the photo by reducing its global contrast and increasing the local contrast. It does so by generating a desaturated and blurred version of the photo. It then combines the RGB channels of the original photo with the desaturated blurred image using either the Linear or Power function. Sounds complicated? Don‚Äôt worry the Local Contrast tool is rather straightforward to use so you don‚Äôt have to understand all its intricacies in order to achieve pleasing results.
Matrix size This parameter determines the size of the transformation matrix. Increasing the Matrix Size may give better results especially when you have chosen large values for Circular Sharpness or Gaussian Sharpness. Note that the plug-in will become very slow when you select large values for this parameter. In most cases you should select a value in the range 3-10.
Save As and Load these buttons are used to do just that. Any Refocus parameters that you have set can be saved to the filesystem and loaded later.
Below you can see few hints to help you work with the refocus plug-in
Preferably perform all cropping color and intensity curve corrections on the image before using this plug-in.
Otherwise use this plug-in before performing any other operations on the image. The reason is that many operations on the image will leave boundaries that are not immediately visible but that will leave nasty artifacts.
Waves Horizontal distorts the photograph with horizontal waves.
Waves Vertical distorts the photograph with vertical waves.
Block Waves 1 divides the image into cells and makes it look as if it is being viewed through glass blocks.

The E-mail Images Tool in Action
Smug is a tool to export images on Smug web service.
I also recommend to switch-on the 'save metadata' options in the digikam; settings page for metadata. This will ensure that EXIF and IPTC data is written into the file. If you forgot to do that you can always catch up by copying the metadata in the database to the files in one go (from the Album menu).
Now we have a lot of stuff already in our database but what if I need to change some of it? digikam; provides a metadata editor for a selected number of attributes the most important ones of course.
The real work begins here as we will apply tags captions and a rating to every photograph. Of course all images requiring the same attribute can be treated as a selection in one action. Lets start with rating or ranking. It's best to start with ranking because for further work you can concentrate on the good shots.
Rating/Ranking
A ranking systematic is implemented in digikam; by the 5 star rating tool. In fact there are 6 levels zero through five stars (*) can be attributed (when saving them into IPTC metadata a translation of levels ensures compatibility with other programs). Rating is rapidly applied with digikam; using keyboard shortcuts or the mouse on single photographs or whole selections. The rating can then be entered as a search criterion or directly from the status bar quick filters. However before you start attributing stars everywhere take a moment to establish personal criteria for ranking. Best practice is to write down your personal match of stars to some qualitative expression that will define what you actually mean when giving 5 stars. Generally there should be much less images rated with increasing star assignment. A ratio of 3-10 between each level has proven useful. That will get you quite far in distinguishing your rating pyramid. Say you choose a ratio of 7 between levels. For every 5 star image you'll then have 7 4 stars 49 3 stars and so on resulting in almost 20000 pictures. Amazing? Yes and 16807 of them you didn't have to rate at all! You even can define a different rating scheme depending on the kind of use 2 stars for commercial use may mean something else than 2 stars holiday photos. It is also a good practice to define a neutral rating everything below is actually a negative rating. This will help you culling and thinning your collection very efficiently. Or you could define purposes to ratings say 0 stars for 'can throw away' 1 star for images in quarantine (decide later) 2 stars for gallery export 3 stars for printing 4 stars for selling 5 stars for 'have to work on' as you please. It must suit  your needs. The following table illustrates a possible evolution for a professional photographer using a ranking ratio of roughly 7 over the next 12 years. It is evident that the good shots can be easily found even within millions of photos.
Magnetic media
Magnetic tapes are used in backup systems much more in professional environments than in home use. Tapes have issues with data retention and changing technology but they are safer in one aspect than CDs and DVDs they are less exposed to scratches and dirt and writing deficiencies. On the other hand they are susceptible to magnetic fields. Throw a magnet next to a tape and it's gone! Tapes should be re-copied every 5-8 years otherwise too many bits will fail and escape the checksum protection. The downside of magnetic tapes is often the recorder price and the restore time (20x longer than from HDD). Tape backup system have seen their best days.
Saveguarding against logical errors

Viewing or Editing a Photograph With Another Application
Sometimes digikam; may not provide all of the capabilities you need. You can open a photograph in another application by clicking with the RMB; on it and selecting from the Open With sub-menu (At the moment this function is available only under Linux;). The list of applications that appear in this menu is controlled by the standard desktop file associations for the image format type of this photograph. Consult the desktop manual for instructions on changing these file associations if the application that you need is not listed.
Note that there can be a problem with meta-data embedded in photographs when they are edited by other image manipulation applications. Some applications do not retain the photograph's meta-data when you save a modified image. This means that if you modify a photograph using one of these programs you will lose information such as orientation aperture etc; that are stored in the EXIF and IPTC tags.
Lossless Image Rotation
There is a difference between rotating a photograph in one of the Views of digikam; or in the Image Editor. The Image Editor uses a different method of rotating an image you may not notice any difference but the Image Editor method can cause some loss of quality in the photograph when saving the picture as JPEG. The rotation methods described here preserve the original quality of the photograph also in JPEG - Files.
Advanced Search Criteria
Thanks to the labeling of the search fields they are pretty much self explaining. What we have to talk about is how they work together if you fill in or select more than one. On the right side of the header (blue area at the top) you find a little link Options. If you click on that one the header will change and you see four options.
Meet All of the following conditions means that your different search parameters will be connected by boolean AND for the search. Example if you selected Album name Holidays and color red the search will find all pictures labeled with red out of the Album Holidays.
Meet Any of the following conditions means that your different search parameters will be connected by boolean OR for the search. Example if you selected Album name Holidays and color red the search will find the content of the Album Holidays and all pictures labeled with red out of your whole collection.
None of these conditions are met means that your different search parameters will be connected by boolean NAND for the search. Again our example if you selected Album name Holidays and color red the search will find all pictures of your collection except those labeled with red and except those out of the Album Holidays.

Image Quality Settings
These settings refer to the Image Quality Sorter tool which you can access via  ToolsMaintenance .
The caption view can be used to type or paste in a caption of unlimited size (see note below). The text is UTF-8 compatible meaning that all special characters are allowed. The captions are copied to EXIF and IPTC fields to be used by other applications.
IPTC data only supports ASCII characters and is limited to 2000 characters (old American norm). All texts will be truncated after 2000 chars and special characters will be malformed. If you intend to use the IPTC caption field in other applications you should be compliant with these restrictions.
After commenting either choose the Apply button or go straight to the next image the captions will be saved.
Next to the Apply button there is the More button. From it you can either choose to read metadata from the selected file to the database or the other way around to write metadata to the files (the latter take place anyway if you chose a metadata setting so that all metadata is always saved to the images).
In the Date amp; Time section which reflects the time of taking the photograph you can change all values. From the date combo-box a calendar opens and the time setting spin-box can also be written by directly typing the time. The dating is copied to the EXIF 'Date and Time' field. If you need to change a number of images for their creating time amp; date there is a more comfortable method available in Batch Queue Manager. This latter option can be found under ImageAdjust time amp; date. Select the images to be changed in the main view and call the tool.
The EXIF standard defines a Makernote tag which allows camera manufacturers to place any custom format metadata in the file. This is used increasingly by camera manufacturers to store a myriad of camera settings not listed in the EXIF standard such as shooting modes post-processing settings serial number focusing modes etc; but this tag format is proprietary and manufacturer specific.
How to Use Makernote Viewer

IPTC Tags
At the bottom of this page it is possible to specify several resolution for images. This way people reading your pages are not forced to download images in large resolutions say 1600x1200 just to see it on a monitor not offering more than say 800x600.
At any time your readers may change resolution among those you specified. That way they may browse through your images in low resolution (and thus fast download time) and when they see an image of special interest they may change to high resolution.
The Destination page
On the destination page you specify several directories and URL's specifying where your pages go.
The philosophy is that you specify a base directory for all your generations and for each generation specify a new subdirectory.
Las Vegas San Francisco Los Angeles and California are all located in USA. Furthermore San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.
Instead of specifying for each and every image from San Francisco that it is in San Francisco and in California and in USA you may instead tell kphotoalbum; that San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California and that California among others are in USA. Doing so the browser (see ) will offer you an item for USA and an item for California in addition to all your normal items. Selecting California you will see all images from San Francisco Los Angeles etc;
In  you can see a browser window containing USA as a super category. To indicate to you that this is a group a special icon is used.
Browser showing USA as a super category
In the context menu for the annotation dialog it is possible to add an item to an existing or new super or sub category. In addition you may simply drag an item to a category to make it a sub category of that item. Notice this requires that you are currently sorting your categories alphabetically. See .
KXStitch 2.0
cross stitch pattern creator and editor by kde;
kxstitch file
KXStitch is a program that lets you create cross stitch patterns and charts. Patterns can be created from scratch on a user defined size of grid which can be enlarged or reduced in size as your pattern progresses. Alternatively you can import images from many graphics formats which will allow you to reduce the number of colors and to restrict the conversion to full stitches or optionally use fractional stitches. You may also use an image as a background. These imported images can then be modified using the supplied tools to produce your final design.
There are many tools to aid designing your pattern from open and filled rectangles and ellipses filled polygons and lines and backstitching. Additionally cut copy and paste can be used to duplicate selected areas. Selected areas can also be rotated 90 180 and 270 degrees anti clockwise or mirrored horizontally or vertically.
Go to ProjectsFetch project to import a project
You then have multiple options to start a new project in the current session depending on where the source files should come from You can just point kdevelop; at an existing directory (see option 2 below) or you can ask kdevelop; to get the sources from a repository.
Assuming you don't already have a version checked out
In the dialog box under Select the source choose to use Subversion Git or one of the other choices
Choose a working directory as destination into which the sources should be checked out
Auto-completion
Probably the most useful of all features in writing new code is auto-completion. Consider for example the following piece of code
In the last line kdevelop; will remember that the variable myride is of type Car and will automatically offer to complete the name of the member function ge as getcolor. In fact all you have to do is to keep typing until the auto-completion feature has reduced the number of matches to one and then hit the Enter; key
Note that you can click on the tool-tip to get more information about the function apart from its return type and whether it is public
Auto-completion can save you a lot of typing if your project uses long variable and function names; furthermore it avoids mis-spelling names (and the resulting compiler errors) and it makes it much simpler to remember the exact names of functions; for example if all of your getters start with get then the auto-completion feature will be able to only present you a list of possible getters when you have typed the first four letters likely reminding you in the process which of the functions is the correct one. Note that for auto-completion to work neither the declaration of the Car class nor of the myride variable need to be in the same file as where you are currently writing code. kdevelop; simply has to know that these classes and variables are connected ie; the files in which these connections are made need to be part of the project you are currently working on.
When copying an existing template make sure you rename it before importing it again. Otherwise you will either overwrite the old template or will end up with two templates with identical names. To rename a template rename the description file to something unique (but keep the suffix) and change the Name entry in the description file.
If you want to write a template from scratch you can start with a sample C++ class template by creating a new project and selecting the C++ Class Template project in category KDevelop.
Building (compiling) projects with custom Makefiles
Many projects describe how source files have to be compiled (and which files have to be recompiled once a source or header file changes) using Makefiles that are interpreted by the make program (see for example GNU make). For simple projects it is often very easy to set up such a file by hand. Larger projects often integrate their Makefiles with the GNU autotools (autoconf autoheader automake). In this section let us simply assume that you have a Makefile for your project and you want to teach kdevelop; how to interact with it.
kdevelop; 4.x doesn't know about the GNU autotools at the time this section is written. If your project uses them you will have to run ./configure or any of the other related commands by hand on a command line. If you want to do this within kdevelop; open the Konsole tool (if necessary add it to the perimeter of the main window using the menu WindowsAdd tool view) that gives you a shell window view and run ./configure from the command line in this view.
elisa; indexes your music either by using Baloo if possible or by searching in a list of paths configured by the user through a dedicated interface.
In case the Baloo support is activated and your setup is not working a notification is shown with hints allowing to deactivate the indexer or to activate the Baloo indexer and to feed elisa; with music tracks.
In case the file indexer is not finding anything a notification is shown with a button to open the configuration interface.
You can find a list of changes at Elisa Project.
Currently no configuration is required before use of elisa;. You can explore the menu of the application to see the customization possibilities. It is possible to choose the paths that will be indexed for music. It is also possible to modify the shortcuts for common actions inside the application.
USALS Rotor - The antenna cable is connected to a single dish with a USALS Rotor controlled via DiSEqC. Multiple satellites can be configured as the rotor will change the dish position when a different satellite is chosen. You need to specify the position of the dish (latitude longitude).
Positions Rotor - The antenna cable is connected to a single dish with a Rotor with a set of fixed positions controlled via DiSEqC. Multiple satellites can be configured as the rotor will change the dish position when a different satellite is chosen.
Disable DiSEqC - The antenna cable is connected to a dish without any elements supporting DiSEqC. This setup is typically used with multipoint bandstacked LNBf where all channels are present at the same time at the antenna cabling.
On a typical satellite system the LNBf uses the power up voltage to select between a lower voltage (13V) for vertical or circular right polarization and a higher voltage (18V) for horizontal or circular left polarization. However due to cabling loss sometimes the LNBf doesn't understand the high voltage and several channels won't tune or will tune wrong. So a few devices offer an option to increase the voltage to a higher setting (14V or 19V). This is enabled via the tri-state Use Higher LNBf voltage option. Three values are possible
tri-state - Don't send a command to the device to adjust the voltage level. That's the default.

Many servers or remote shares are password protected. In that case a password dialog appears asking you for the user name and password. The same happens if you click the Ctrl; TAuthentication menu entry.
Screenshot of the authentication dialog
The authentication dialog
If a user name has already been provided it will be shown in the respective field. If it is wrong or no user name was provided you have to enter one. The password however may be left blank. Clicking the OK button will commit the data. Depending on your choice in the configuration dialog the user name and password will be stored permanently in a digital wallet or not all. In the latter case you will have to provide them every time they are needed.
Defining Custom Options
The progress is calculated from the number of transferred files devided by the total number of files present on the share. Their size is not considered. That means that one very large file adds to the progress as much as a very small one does. Also due to the way rsync displays the transfer progress the progress bar is only updated after the transfer of the file finished.
Opening a Share
smb4k; provides two possibilities to open a mounted share
Open a share with konsole;
You can open the mounted share in konsole; by selecting the Ctrl;LOpen with Konsole action. This is useful if you need to run shell scripts on the share or similar.
smb4k; offers the use of different profiles. They are intended for better handling of different network neighborhoods eg; if you are using your laptop at home and at work.
By default the use of different profiles is disabled and a default profile is used one profile for everything. Most users won't have to change anything because the default behavior satisfies their needs completely. However for some users this feature might be very useful.
Enabling and Managing Profiles
The use of different profiles can be enabled in the configuration dialog. The first profile in the list most likely the Home profile is picked to be the active profile. You can also enable the profile migration assistant.
Two profiles are pre-defined Home and Work but you can define as many profiles as you want. A new profile is added by entering its name into the edit line on the Profiles configuration page and clicking Add afterwards.
The default login is used by default to authenticate to the servers in your network neighborhood. If you enable this feature a password dialog pops up where you can provide the default login information.
Screenshot of the default login input dialog
The default login input dialog
You have to fill in at least the user name. Empty passwords are supported.
The Wallet Entries tab contains an editor with that you can modify or remove existing wallet entries.
Recurse into subdirectories.
Option -u/--update
This forces rsync1 to skip any files that exist on the destination and have a modification time that is newer than the one of the source file. (If an existing destination file has a modification time equal to the source file's it will be updated if the sizes are different.)
Option --inplace
This causes rsync1 not to create a new copy of the file and then move it into place. Instead rsync1 will overwrite the existing file meaning that the rsync algorithm cannot accomplish the full amount of network reduction it might be able to otherwise. One exception to this is if you combine the option with --backup since rsync1 is smart enough to use the backup file as the basis file for the transfer.
With this option the incremental rsync1 algorithm is not used and the whole file is sent as-is instead. The transfer may be faster if this option is used when the bandwidth between the source and destination machines is higher than the bandwidth to disk (especially when the "disk" is actually a networked file system). This is the default when both the source and destination are specified as local paths.
Option -x/--one-file-system
This tells rsync1 to avoid crossing a file system boundary when recursing. This does not limit the user's ability to specify items to copy from multiple file systems just rsync1's recursion through the hierarchy of each folder that the user specified and also the analogous recursion on the receiving side during deletion. Also keep in mind that rsync1 treats a "bind" mount to the same device as being on the same file system.
Option --existing/--ignore-non-existing
This tells rsync1 to skip updating files that do not exist yet on the destination. If this option is combined with the --ignore-existing option no files will be updated (which can be useful if all you want to do is to delete missing files).

Special Thanks
The smb4k; team would like to thank everyone who contributed by sending patches. Also a big "Thank you!" goes to Rashid N. Achilov shelton@sentry.granch.ru who convinced us to port smb4k; to FreeBSD and helped us a great deal to achieve this goal.
An entry is the basic record in tellico;. Each entry contains a single value for each field in the collection. A collection may have an unlimited number of entries in theory although since the whole collection is always resident in memory too many entries could slow down the application.
tellico; has been tested with a collection of 10000 entries and the speed was satisfactory. However if many large images are included in the collection the loading and processing time does slow down greatly. Performance can be improved by having tellico; store images separate from the data file itself either in the application-specific folder or a folder relative to the data file. More information can be found in the configuration section.

Amazon.com
Using the Amazon Web Services appname; can search any of nine different international sites operated by Amazon.com for information United States United Kingdom Germany Japan France Canada China Spain and Italy.
Configuring each Amazon.com source involves three settings the server location image size and associate's ID. Some information from Amazon.com may include an image such as a book or video cover. That image may be downloaded in three different sizes depending on the item. The associate's ID must be used to access the Amazon.com Web Services and is included in the links back to the item as dictated by the license agreement for the use of the Amazon.com Web Services.
External Scripts or Applications
As an easier way for appname; to integrate with third-party plugins external scripts or applications may be used as an interface for searching other information sources. appname; will execute a command and pass the search terms as command-line options.
If you want to include an image in the entry you can use the standard kde; File Selector by clicking the Select Image button in the Entry Editor or you can drag an image from the file manager or web browser into the Entry Editor.
When you select an entry the Entry View shows a formatted view of the entry's contents. You can change the template used for showing the entry in the Configuration Dialog.
The entries in the collection are grouped together when they share the same values for certain fields such as the author or director. You can change the field used for grouping by using the combo box in the toolbar or the SettingsGroup Selection menu item.
You can use the Quick Filter in the toolbar to quickly limit the visible entries to ones which contain the word you type. The filter is also useful when you want to quickly find an entry. You can type in the title or some other unique word that identifies the entry and the Column View will only show the entries that match the filter. The status bar shows you how many entries are in the collection and how many are currently being filtered.
General Usage
You can edit more than one entry at a time by holding down the Shift; or Ctrl; key and selecting multiple entries.
You can convert an existing book collection to a bibliography which can then be exported to bibtex or Bibtexml format.
If more than one field is formatted as a name then an additional group named "People" is added to the collection allowing authors and editors to be sorted or printed together for example.
You can modify the appearance of the printed output by modifying the tellico-printing.xsl file. The file generates HTML; and the CSS; within the stylesheet governs things like the font the margins etc.

If set unrelated items will be diffed as if they were related. Otherwise subversion will remove one side and add it on other side again.
If not set and merge would require deletion of an modified or unversioned item the subversion merge fails. Otherwise this items will be deleted.
If set subversion sends only notifications what it would do but doesn't modify the working copy.
Using external program for merge
See  for details how to setup the external merge tool. kdesvn; generates the command line as described there. Before it does following
KURLList
Revert in KIO is always non-recursive no questions (calling app must do it itself)
KURL item bool checkRepos bool recurse
item - the item whos info should be checked checkRepos - check if there are newer versions in the repository recurse - whether to check recursive or not.
KURL bool recursive
Print difference against repository ie; local changes
kdesvn exec diff myfile.c
Print difference between revisions
kdesvn exec diff -r 2120 myfile.c

LVM volume group is a collection of LVM physical volumes that can be partitioned into logical partitions. It might be used to create file systems spanning over multiple devices or to split encrypted LUKS volume into smaller partitions.
LVM logical volumes are similar to normal partitions except that they reside on LVM volume group. Also the location of LVM logical partitions does not matter and they do not have to be physically contiguous. Therefore partman; does not allow to move LVM logical volumes and displays the remaining free space at the end of the device.
partman; divides the work it does up in operations jobs and commands.
Operations are the most visible of the three. If you pick an action in the graphical user interface this will likely result in a new operation being added to the list of pending operations. The idea behind that is You will most probably want to set up quite a number of steps to transform the current state of your disk devices to the state you have in mind. Some of these steps may take quite a long time to execute (like copying a large file system or resizing a file system that is nearly full). To save you from having to sit in front of your computer for a long time waiting for one step to finish and then starting the next one operations allow you to exactly specify how the computer's devices should look like once everything is finished then let partman; apply the operations and come back when it has executed all of them.
Operations are kept in a list of pending operations. As long as an operation has not been applied it can still be taken back easily and nothing will have been modified.
This command is only enabled if a partition is selected that is not currently mounted and whose file system can be copied. Extended partitions can not be copied.
Ctrl;V Partition Paste
Paste a partition This command pastes the partition from partman;'s clipboard to the currently selected partition or unallocated area.
When pasting to an unallocated area a dialog will open allowing you to move or grow the inserted copy. When overwriting an existing partition this dialog will not be shown.
This command is only enabled if a partition is currently in the clipboard and a valid target (either a partition or an unallocated area) is selected. The target must also be large enough to hold the source and can not be mounted. You can not copy a partition onto itself.
By pressing the Enter; key when the timer is running you freeze that particular time and you create a new lap time. These times are always visible in the table on the left of the application where you can sort them by clicking the Lap time column's header. You can also add a custom text annotation to each lap by double-clicking the cells within the Note column.
The menubar (hidden by default) provides access to all commands and configuration options. The menubar can be toggled with Show Menubar (Ctrl;M) from the Settings menu or the menu button in the toolbar.

Some pages try to set cookies from servers other than the one you are seeing the HTML; page from. For example they show you advertisements and the advertisements are from another computer often one that belongs to a large advertising group. These advertisements may try to set a cookie which would allow them to track the pages you view across multiple web sites.
Enabling this option will mean only cookies that come from the same web server as you are explicitly connecting to will be accepted.
An increasingly common use for cookies is not to track your movements across many visits to a web site but to just follow what you do during one single visit. Session cookies are saved as long as you are looking at the site and deleted when you leave it.
Web sites can use this information for various things most commonly it is a convenience so that you do not have to keep logging in to view pages. For example on a webmail site without some kind of session ID you would have to give your password again for each email you want to read. There are other ways to achieve this but cookies are simple and very common.
Enabling this option means that session cookies are always accepted even if you don't accept any other kind and even if you choose to reject cookies from a particular site session cookies from that site will be accepted.
After typing the name of the server select the identifying string in the next combo box which is labeled Use the following identification. The Real identification ie; the strings sent to the server is displayed in the field.

Autostart Manager
This module is a configuration tool for managing what programs start up with your personal plasma;. It allows you to add programs or scripts so they automatically start during the startup or shutdown of your plasma; session and to manage them.
Please note that in this module all changes are immediately applied.
The program scans $HOME/.config/autostart/ $HOME/.config/plasma-workspace/env and $HOME/.config/plasma-workspace/shutdown folders to check what programs and scripts are already there and displays them. It allows you to manage them easily.
Window Manager Colors
As previously stated the Window Manager set has its own roles independent of those in other sets. These are (currently) only accessible via Common Colors and are as follows
Active Titlebar mdash; used to draw the title bar background borders and/or decorations for the active window (that is the one with input focus). Not all window decorations will use this in the same way and some may even use the Normal Background from the Window set to draw the title bar.
Active Titlebar Text mdash; used to draw the title bar text when Active Titlebar is used to draw the title bar background. May also be used for other foreground elements which use Active Titlebar as the background.
The Inactive Titlebar [Text] roles are the same as the above but for inactive windows rather than active windows.
FontConfig match. This allows you to enter a family name and see the family that fontconfig would actually use.
Font file type.
Font file name.
Font file location.

A place to see the pressed state of buttons on your joystick and if the buttons are mapped correctly. When a joystick button is pressed PRESSED will appear next to the logical number (as the computer sees it) of the button which was pressed.
This displays the numerical values of the axis positions. 0 is centered and the maximum and minimum values depend on the joystick and the particular axis.
Clicking on Calibrate will open a dialog to calibrate every axis on your joystick.
Main toolbar text location Secondary toolbar text location
These drop down boxes lets you determine where on the button in both toolbars the text name of the button will appear as the default. If No Text is selected then there is no text on the toolbar buttons. If Text Only is selected then the button's icon is replaced with a text name of the button. If Text Beside Icons is selected then the name of the button will be placed to the right of the icon. If Text Below Icons is selected the default will be to have the text of the button below the icon.
This option only specifies the default location. Each application can override the setting used in this panel.
The global menu is now automatically enabled when you place a global menu applet in a panel or add the menu button to the window decoration in Buttons tab of the Window Decorations module.

The first menu that appears allows you to select the type of trigger. The following options are available
These are standard keyboard shortcuts that will be recognized anywhere as long as a kde; plasma; Workspace is running.
Window Actions are triggers that occur when something happens to a particular window like when it appears gains focus or is closed.
A mouse gesture action is triggered when a particular movement of the mouse (or touchpad or touchscreen) is performed.
Once you've selected the type of trigger another submenu appears that allows you to select an action type. The following types are available
The easiest way to fill in this information is to open the desired window then click the Autodetect button at the bottom of this section and finally click on the desired trigger window. All three window characteristics will be populated with the information from that window and you can then adjust the settings as necessary.
This lets you restrict the match to a particular type of window. The following options are available
Normal - A regular application window.
Desktop - The main desktop is actually a special window all its own.
Dialog - A small window that is part of a normal application such as a message box or a configuration screen.
To enable keyboard mouse mode you need to select the check box labeled Move pointer with keyboard (using the num pad). When you do this the other settings will become enabled and you can customize the keyboard pointer behavior further if required.
The various keys on the number pad move in the direction you would expect. Note that you can move diagonally as well as up down left and right. The 5 key emulates a click to a pointer button typically LMB;. You change which button is emulated by using the / key (which makes it LMB;) * key (which makes it MMB;) and - (which makes it RMB;). Using the + emulates a double click to the selected pointer button. You can use the 0 key to emulate holding down the selected pointer button (for easy dragging) and then use the . to emulate releasing the selected pointer button.
This is the time (in milliseconds) between the initial key press and the first repeated motion event for mouse key acceleration.
This is the time in milliseconds between repeated motion events for mouse key acceleration.
This is the time in milliseconds before the pointer reaches a maximum speed for mouse key acceleration.

Focus Follows Mouse
Moving the mouse pointer actively over a normal window activates it. New windows such as the mini command line invoked with Alt;F2 will receive the focus without you having to point the mouse at them explicitly. eg; windows randomly appearing under the mouse will not gain the focus. Focus stealing prevention takes place as usual. Think as Click To Focus just without having to actually click.
In other window managers this is sometimes known as Sloppy focus follows mouse.
Focus Follows Mouse - Mouse Precedence
This is mostly the same as Focus Follows Mouse. If an active window has to be chosen by the system (eg; because the currently active one was closed) the window under the mouse is the preferred candidate. Choose this if you want a hover controlled focus.
Appearance amp; Fixes
As the name implies Window matching is used to specify criteria to match one or more windows. The other three tabs are used to alter the attributes of the matching windows.
Panels can also be affected.
Window Matching
Each window rule has user specified Window Matching criteria. kwin; uses the criteria to determine whether the rule is applicable for an application.
Click OK to close the window.
Application on all Desktops and Handle One Child Window Uniquely
Except for conversation windows display kopete; and its children windows on all desktops and skip the systray and pager. For children conversation windows treat them as the parent window except show them in systray.
For each attribute use the Force parameter so it can not be overridden.
In order to implement the above two rules need to be created
kdesu; will check the password you entered and gives an error message if it is not correct. The checking is done by executing a test program /bin/true. If this succeeds the password is assumed to be correct.
Password Keeping
For your comfort kdesu; implements a keep password feature. If you are interested in security you should read this paragraph.
Allowing kdesu; to remember passwords opens up a (small) security hole in your system. Obviously kdesu; does not allow anybody but your user id to use the passwords but if done without caution this would lowers root's security level to that of a normal user (you). A hacker who breaks into your account would get root access. kdesu; tries to prevent this. The security scheme it uses is in my opinion at least reasonably safe and is explained here.
kdesu; uses a daemon called kdesud. The daemon listens to a UNIX; socket in /tmp for commands. The mode of the socket is 0600 so that only your user id can connect to it. If password keeping is enabled kdesu; executes commands through this daemon. It writes the command and root's password to the socket and the daemon executes the command using su as describe before. After this the command and the password are not thrown away. Instead they are kept for a specified amount of time. This is the timeout value from in the control module. If another request for the same command is coming within this time period the client does not have to supply the password. To keep hackers who broke into your account from stealing passwords from the daemon (for example by attaching a debugger) the daemon is installed set-group-id nogroup. This should prevent all normal users (including you) from getting passwords from the kdesud process. Also the daemon sets the DISPLAY environment variable to the value it had when it was started. The only thing a hacker can do is execute an application on your display.
The grey areas are free and the blue and green areas are used.
The exact values of each type of memory are not critical and they change regularly. When you evaluate this page look at trends.
Does your computer have plenty of free space (grey areas)? If not you can increase the swap size or increase the physical memory.
Also if your computer seems sluggish is your physical memory full and does the hard drive always seem to be running? This suggests that you do not have enough physical memory and your computer is relying on the slower virtual memory for commonly used data. Increasing your physical memory will improve the responsiveness of your computer.

kalgebra;
kalgebra; is a MathML-based graph calculator that ships with kde; Education project. See http//edu.kde.org/kalgebra/ for more information.
Qalculate!
Qalculate! is not your regular software replication of the cheapest available calculator. Qalculate! aims to make full use of the superior interface power and flexibility of modern computers. The center of attention in Qalculate! is the expression entry. Instead of entering each number in a mathematical expression separately you can directly write the whole expression and later modify it. The interpretation of expressions is flexible and fault tolerant and if you nevertheless do something wrong Qalculate! will tell you so. Not fully solvable expressions are however not errors. Qalculate! will simplify as far as it can and answer with an expression. In addition to numbers and arithmetic operators an expression may contain any combination of variables units and functions. See http//qalculate.sourceforge.net/ for more information.

kig; has context menus for its objects. Try RMB; clicking on an object in order to see a context menu appear. There are many options for constructing other objects setting colours pen width style and even hiding moving or deleting objects. Some objects have options of their own (eg; you can redefine certain points to be constrained to a line if they previously weren't etc;). These options should be very straightforward to understand.
Some of the actions in the context menu of an object need another defined object as reference for example

Search playlists
This is a playlist which is based off of a search. You can create a playlist like this by clicking  FileNewSearch Playlist or by clicking on the Search Playlist button on the toolbar.
After creating this playlist it will keep track of which songs in the Collection List match your criteria and automatically update itself accordingly whenever the Collection List changes.
Playlists are organized in the Playlist pane which is the vertical bar at the left. In this pane is an icon for every playlist you have. There are different view mode for this pane which can be selected from the ViewView Modes menu.
Default View mode
Select a folder (or folders) to add to the collection list. These folders will also be rescanned whenever juk; is started or FileReload  is chosen.
You can also select folders that should not be automatically searched (which would override the list of folders to scan on startup). This way you can avoid having to completely change up your music layout on-disk just to keep juk; from automatically grabbing songs you do not want or need managed from within juk;.

Audio CDs don't have track names but the Internet CD Database is a clever system which uses a special unique identifier generated from the number and length of tracks on each CD to cross-reference a track listing. Track listings are contributed by the Internet community and made available to all. Occasionally there will be multiple entries. You can specify which one to use.
You can submit your own track listings using kscd; the kde; CD player.
By default audiocd tries to pick the best one.

kwave; Revision History
Each property line starts with ##.
After the properties comes a list of samples with one sample per line. When using multiple channels the samples are separated by commas.
Lines might end with a carriage return and/or a line feed character (so DOS files are supported too). But when saving files will always be saved with line feed character as the end of the line.
Empty lines and characters after a # are treated as comments and are ignored.
Values have to be given in signed integer format with a 24 bit range which is the internal storage format of kwave;.
You can also extend or shrink the selection to a specific point by holding down the Shift; key while clicking with the LMB;. Depending on which border is nearer the left or right border of the selection will be set until the new position. If there was nothing selected will be set from the beginning.

The Add Contact Wizard creates a new Metacontact using one or more im; systems by leading you through the following pages.
Welcome Page. Here you can choose whether you want to use the kde; Address Book for this contact. Storing im; information in the kde; Address Book will enable other kde; im; programs to share contact information with kopete; and in future kde; applications may use kopete; to send information via im;. If you prefer to keep your im; contacts separated clear the check box here.
Choose kde; Address Book entry. By choosing an entry from your kde; Address Book you can use its name as a Display Name in kopete;. You can also create a new entry here. This page doesn't show if you chose not to use the kde; Address Book.
Select Display Name and Group. Here you can enter a Display Name (the name used for this person inside kopete;) and choose the groups they are a member of.
Select im; Accounts. Here you can choose which accounts you want to use to chat to the new contact. If you only have one im; account you won't see this screen.
Here you can choose to have kopete; set you away after a period of inactivity.
Predefined Away Messages
You can define as many custom away messages as you like here and choose from them when you go Away using the Status button on the main toolbar.

If the authentication was successful then you know that you are really talking to your friend. Any imposter should have a hard time guessing what you're typing in so you'll be able to catch them in the act.
Pipes allows you to pipe incoming or outgoing messages through an external script or executable. An incoming message will be piped through the executable before it reaches your chat window while outgoing messages will be piped through the executable before they are sent over the Internet. Pipes can receive text in one of three forms   Plain text body The body of the message in plain ascii; text   HTML; text body The body of the message in HTML; as it would be if your chat peer had sent HTML; to you which will be rendered in the chat window   XML; full message An XML; document that describes all the characteristics of the message including the HTML; body.   For most purposes you probably want to use the plain text body or HTML; text body options. These can be used with programs such as translators or summarizers. The XML; format is only appropriate for use with a program or script written specifically to work with this plugin. If you would like to write a program or script that does work with this plugin see the more detailed documentation.
This plugin uses a database to gather information about your contacts' activity patterns. You can use this to see when a contact is usually online for example.
Text Effect applies funny effects to your messages before sending them like coloring them or changing the case of the words. Just don't forget you have activated it - we've had bug reports from forgetful Text Effect users!
The Translator plugin lets you define a preferred language for each Metacontact and then translates messages to or from them using web based translation services such as Google. Set your own preferred language in the Select and Configure Plugins dialog. Each contact's preferred language can be set on its context menu.
The NextContent template is a message fragment for consecutive messages. It will be inserted into the main message block. The HTML template should contain the bare minimum to display a message.

The decryption operation will take some time depending on the number of files and on their size. You can track the progress of the operation from the notification applet provided by plasma;. From the notification plasmoid you can also abort the decryption operation if necessary.
-e --encrypt
Encrypts the given list of files after asking a passphrase. This option is implicitly set if there are no other options.
-d --decrypt
Decrypts the given list of files after asking the decryption key. Note that encrypt and decrypt are mutually exclusive.
When you start cervisia; and open a working copy by choosing  File Open Sandbox  you can see two main areas in cervisia;'s main window the top one is a hierarchical (tree) view of the current working copy; the bottom area is used to display the CVS; commands cervisia; issues to perform its tasks as well as the output generated by these commands.
By default cervisia; does not display the files contained by the sub-folders so you will have to click the folders you want to see. To display all files of the working copy select  View Unfold File Tree . To close back all folders from the working copy choose  View Fold File Tree .
According to the settings in your .cvsignore files the files you usually do not want to include into the repository - such as object files - are not shown in the tree view. For each file you see its corresponding status. In the default setting after opening the sandbox this is "Unknown" because cervisia; delays the fetching of information until you select the files and folders whose status you want to update or view and choose  File Update  or  File Status . With this approach you have a minimal amount of functionality available even if you do not have a permanent connection to the CVS; server.
A screenshot of cervisia;'s main view
The commands in the File menu usually act only on the files which you have marked. You may also mark folders. Now choose  File Status  or press F5. cervisia; issues a
In the annotate dialog you see in a window the latest version of the selected file (or the revision Aversion in case you launched the annotate dialog from the Browse log dialog). In the columns before the text you get some information related to the latest change in each line. In the first column the line number is displayed. In the second column you see the name of the author and revision number. Finally in the third column you see the actual content of that line.
Consequently when a certain line appears strange to you or you assume a bug there you can immediately see who is responsible for that line. But not only that you can also find out why that line was changed. To this end move the mouse cursor over the respective revision number. Then a tooltip appears that shows the log message and the date of the change.
Browsing CVS; Logs
When you mark one file in the main view and choose Browse Log from the View menu or right click the marked file and choose Browse Log from the context menu the CVS Log dialog is shown (if you mark more than one nothing happens as cervisia; can only generate and parse the log for one file at a time). This dialog offers functionality that is beyond viewing the file's history. Using it as a version browser you can
View the revision author date branch commit message and tags for each version of the marked file.
The development model usually followed when CVS; is used is called unreserved checkouts. Each developer has his own sandbox where he can edit files as he likes. If when the watch features - like cvs edit - are used multiple developers can work on files synchronously. Changes done by a different developer are merged into the local sandbox when an update is performed.
Other revision control systems - like RCS and SourceSafe use a different model. When a developer wants to a edit a file he has to lock it. Only one developer at a time can a lock a file. When he has finished editing the lock is released. On the one hand with this model conflicts can never happen. On the other hand two developers cannot work on the same file at the same time even when their changes do not affect each other. This can be a bottleneck. We are not going to discuss the organizational benefits of both approaches. Nevertheless we mention that although CVS; has some support for locking it is not the preferred way of working with CVS;. You should not use these features unless you are sure that your project manager allows them.
With cervisia; you lock files as follows. Select the desired files in the main view. Then choose AdvancedLock Files. This runs the command
cvs admin -l file names
The reverse effect is achieved by using AdvancedUnlock Files. This runs the command
AdvancedMerge
Merges either a given branch or the modifications between two tags into the selected files. See .
AdvancedAdd Watch
Adds a watch for a set of events on the selected files. See .
AdvancedRemove Watch
Starting kompare;
A shortcut for starting kompare; can be found in the application menu in the Development group DevelopmentKompare.
When kompare; starts the first thing it does is display a dialog from which to select the files you wish to compare. Special settings for the properties of the diff and the appearance thereof can also be selected. In the file form select a source and destination source to compare. This can be any two files folders or a URL; and a file. Once the source and destination are selected click the Compare button.
Once kompare; has discovered the differences it will display the main interface. When comparing two files or a URL and a file the process takes just a few seconds. However when comparing folders with many subfolders and files this process can take awhile.
For explanation of the options available from diff and appearance forms see .
Lines that have been changed modified between source and destination.
Lines that have been added between source and destination.
Any of the above states where the difference has been applied between source and destination.

If you have no access to the original translation template file (it is a common practice on some commercial translation projects) then you can use a translation file from the related language. Just choose the FileClear all translated entries menu item or use Ctrl;Alt;D shortcut to clear all translation units.
To the main window one can add many more sections like Alternate Translations Primary Sync Secondary Sync Binary Units by using SettingsToolviews from the main menu.
You can add or remove actions in the toolbars using SettingsConfigure Toolbars from the main menu.
Here you can configure the toolbars.

Detects stale source directories in a CVS tree
pruneemptydirs -f
pruneemptydirs is used to clean up a local CVS tree. It detects directories containing remnants of old stuff which has been removed from the CVS. Such stale directories often break compilation. The current directory and all directories beneath it will be examined.
To keep a selection for later use simply save it into a kbackup; profile file. Use the File menu and select Save Profile.
To reload a selection into kbackup; use the File Load Profile menu item.
kbackup; saves in a profile the selections for all included folders/files excluded folders/files the target folder/URL; defined archive prefix the defined maximum slice file size etc;
If you want to ease the usage of backing up every day the same set of files simply store your settings into a kbackup; profile (a .kbp file) and pass that file on the command line.

Selecting a Secret Key for Signing
First you can choose the key you will use to sign the key. Then you can enter how carefully you checked that she really is the person she pretends to be. This information will be stored together with the signature so it is a guidance for everyone else who might need that signature (more on this below). And then comes the option that would help you if you can't meet Alice in person Local signature (cannot be exported). When you activate that option a special version of a signature will be created that can never even by accident leave you keyring.
But why is it important how carefully you checked Alice's identity? Who should care? There is a different way to solve your problem with the identity of Alice. If you can't visit Alice anytime soon just think of Trent. You know Trent has a keypair too. And Trent is a globetrotter being on a different continent at least twice a month. If you are lucky he will fly close to Alice soon. So you will go and meet with Trent to sign keys. Then you will drop Alice a note that Trent will be at her place soon and ask her if she can meet with him too to sign keys. After all this has happened you know that Trent's key can be trusted and Trent knows that Alice's key can be trusted. If you trust Trent that he has carefully checked Alice's identity then you can also trust her key.
These relationships between keys and their owners form a so called web of trust. Within that web there are some important values that define how trustworthy a particular key is. The first thing is how carefully the identity of the key owner was checked. That is the value you have seen above in the secret key selection window. For example you will likely know how to verify your local countries identity card but one from a completely different country may be hard to verify. So you could say that you have very carefully checked Trent's identity because you have seen his identity card and it looks very much the same as yours. But Trent although he has seen both Alice's identity card and driver license might say he has only done casual checking of her identity as he is not absolutely sure about the documents from that part of the world.
The next important value is how much you trust the other person to verify documents. You know Trent is good at that. But George for example is no one you would call smart. He barely looked at your id card when you met him for key signing. You are sure that George is the person he pretends to be as you checked his documents carefully. But he doesn't seem to really care if he checks other people so you will have a high trust in the key of George but a very low trust in the signatures of George. If you open the properties of a key you will find the field Owner Trust. This is how much you trust the key owner when he signs keys. This value will not be exported it is completely up to your personal preference.

What is akregator;?
akregator; is a kde; application for reading online news feeds. It has a powerful user-friendly interface for reading feeds and the management of them.
akregator; is a lightweight and fast program for displaying news items provided by feeds supporting all commonly-used versions of RSS and Atom feeds. Its interface is similar to those of e-mail programs thus hopefully being very familiar to the user. Useful features include searching within article titles management of feeds in folders and setting archiving preferences. Feeds can be displayed in a similar manner to e-mails. Websites related to a feed can be shown in akregator;'s embedded browser or at the users' choice opened in an external browser.
RSS and Atom feeds
RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is an XML;-based format used for publishing news or articles in a machine-readable form. An RSS or Atom file is also called a feed. A program that can be used to read such feeds is called a feed reader or aggregator hence the title of the application akregator;.

kalarm; is a personal alarm message command and email scheduler by kde;.
kdepim
kalarm
alarm
Check Time to enter a time when the alarm is to be triggered.
Check Date only to specify that the alarm should only have a date not a time.
Check Time from now to enter how long (in hours and minutes) after the alarm is created that it should be triggered.
In the Recurrence Rule group box in the Recurrence tab no day or month need be selected for weekly or yearly recurrences respectively.
Alarm Calendars
In the Post-alarm action field enter a shell command to execute when the alarm is acknowledged (whether by clicking Close or by using the close button in the window's titlebar). It is not executed in any of the following circumstances
When a reminder message is closed.
When you defer the alarm except when the deferred alarm is finally acknowledged.
When the alarm message is closed due to logging out.
See Command Alarms below for details of how shell commands are executed.
When an alarm is displayed on top of a full screen application it is shown as a non-modal window regardless of this configuration setting. This is due to a limitation of the window system.
Positioning of Message Windows
You can choose in the Configuration dialog which of two schemes should be used to position alarm message windows
The windows are displayed as far away from the current mouse cursor as possible. This minimizes disruption to your work flow and minimizes the possibility of accidentally acknowledging the alarm.
The windows are displayed in the center of the screen. To reduce the chance of accidentally acknowledging the alarm the buttons on the window are initially disabled becoming active only after a configurable delay.
Prompt for which calendar to store in When you create a new alarm or alarm template and there is more than one writeable alarm calendar you will be prompted to choose which calendar to save it in. Note that when alarms are saved on expiry they are always stored in the default archived alarm calendar without prompting.
Archived Alarms group box These options control the storage of archived alarms in the default archived alarm calendar.
Keep alarms after expiry Select this option to archive expired and deleted alarms. Deselect it to keep no record of alarms once they cease to be active. Note that deleted alarms are only archived if they have previously been triggered. If you delete an alarm before it ever triggers it is discarded.
Discard archived alarms after Set the number of days to store expired and deleted alarms in the archive after which they are permanently deleted.
Clear archived alarms This button discards all currently archived alarms from the default archived alarm calendar. (Other archived alarm calendars are left unchanged in case they are shared with other people.) This has no effect on alarms which subsequently expire or are deleted; they will continue to be archived according to the selected options.
Specify the path or URL; of an audio file to be played repeatedly either until Stop Play is used or for as long as the alarm message is displayed. --play --beep and --speak cannot be specified with this option.
--recurrence spec
Set the alarm to recur. Specify the recurrence using iCalendar syntax (defined in RFC2445) eg; FREQ=MONTHLY;COUNT=4;INTERVAL=3;BYDAY=-1MO. --until cannot be specified with this option.
-r --repeat count
Set the number of times the alarm should be triggered or if a recurrence is specified with --recurrence the number of times the alarm should be triggered each time --recurrence activates it (ie; a repetition within a recurrence). If --recurrence is not present specify -1 to repeat the alarm indefinitely. --interval must be and --until cannot be specified with this option.
Specifies the background color for displaying the file. The string may be in the format #RRGGBB (as returned by QColorname()) where RR GG and BB are two-digit hexadecimal values for red green and blue. Alternatively the string may be in any of the other formats accepted by QColorsetNamedColor() such as a name from the X color database (eg; red or steelblue). Set the string to null to specify the current default background color.
scheduleFile() is a DBus; call to schedule the specified text or image file for display at the specified date and time. Apart from specifying a file path or URL; and omitting the foreground color and font its usage is identical to scheduleMessage - see the description of that function for further details.
scheduleCommand
schedule a new alarm which executes a shell command.
commandLine
This program is named after Cleopatra a famous female Egyptian pharaoh that lived at the time of Julius Caesar with whom she had a child Caesarion unacknowledged as his heir.
The name was chosen since this program originates from the Auml;gypten Projects (Auml;gypten is German for Egypt). kleopatra; is the German spelling of Cleopatra.
Main Functions
Viewing the Local Keybox
kleopatra;'s main function is to display and edit the contents of the local keybox which is similar to gpg;'s concept of keyrings albeit one should not stretch this analogy too much.
CertificatesTrust Root Certificate
Marks this (smime;) root certificate as trusted.
In some ways this is the equivalent of  for smime; root certificates. You can however only choose betweenmdash;in openpgp; termsmdash;ultimate trust and never trust.
The backend (by way of gpgagent;) will ask at root certificate import time whether to trust the imported root certificate. However that function must be explicitly enabled in the backend configuration (allow-mark-trusted in gpg-agent.conf or either GnuPGnbsp;System GPGnbsp;Agent Allow clients to mark keys as "trusted" or S/MIMEnbsp;Validation Allow to mark root certificates as trusted under ).
Enabling that functionality in the backend can lead to popups from pinentry; at inopportune times (eg; when verifying signatures) and can thus block unattended email processing. For that reason and because it is desirable to be able to distrust a trusted root certificate again kleopatra; allows manual setting of trust.
The user name if any to use for logging into the server.
This column is only shown if the option Show user and password information (below the table) is checked.
The password if any to use for logging into the server.
Check this column if this entry should be used for x509; (smime;) certificate searches.
Only ldap; (and ldaps;) servers are supported for smime;.
Configuring ldap; request options
Entirely disables the use of ldap; for smime;.
When looking for the location of a crl; the to-be-tested certificate usually contains what are known as "crl; Distribution Point" (DP) entries which are URL;s describing the way to access the crl;. The first found DP entry is used.
With this option all entries using the ldap; scheme are ignored when looking for a suitable DP.
Entering an ldap; server here will make all ldap; requests go to that server first. More precisely this setting overrides any specified host and port part in an ldap; URL; and will also be used if host and port have been omitted from the URL;.
is-cardkey
the key material is stored on a smartcard (instead of on the computer).
has-secret-key
the secret key for this key pair is available.
is-openpgp-key
New Identity Dialog
You have to enter the name of the new identity into the New Identity edit field. This will be the name shown in the identity list.
You can choose how the new identity should be initialized by checking one of the three radio buttons in the middle of the dialog
All fields of the new identity are cleared or preset with standard values.
Uses the values from Account Details Password amp; User Account in the systemsettings; category Common Appearance and Behavior.
In the Date Display section you can choose between several date formats. The Localized Format is the one you can specify under Country/Region amp; Language in the systemsettings;. Smart format will show today yesterday etc; The Custom format you can get a description of the possible values by clicking on Custom format information option.
If the Close message window after replying or forwarding option is activated kmail; will close the message window after replying to or forwarding the message that is displayed in the window. This only applies to the separate message window not to the embedded message preview pane.
By default Enable access key is enabled. Access keys allow you to use the keyboard keys for functions which would perhaps normally be done with the mouse such as following links. For more information on access keys please see Access keys.
Show HTML status bar activates a bar at the left side of the reader pane that tells you if a message is html; or not. This is important because html; messages might imitate the look of a signed and encrypted message so you should be aware of the fact that you are reading an html; message. The html; status bar itself cannot be influenced by the html; code of the message.
Enable Replace smileys by emoticons if you want smileys like -) appearing in the message text to be replaced by emoticons (small pictures) such as   .
Warn if certificates/keys expire soon
If checked kmail; will warn when an smime; certificate or openpgp; key is used which will expire soon.
The period in which to warn before key/certificate expiration can then be configured separately for signing and encryption keys as well as (in the case of smime;) for end-user certificates intermediate CA certificates and root certificates.
Re-Enable All quot;Donapos;t Ask Againquot; Warnings
Apart from the main warnings described above there are more warning and information messages which contain an option to not show them again. If you would like to re-enable them after choosing not to show them again you can achieve this by pressing this button.

How to remove alternate line colourings?
I've seen demonstrations of remote control behavior with kmail;. Is there any documentation on the available interfaces?
You can get a list of functions by using this command in a shell qdbus org.kde.kmail /KMail. Then you can control kmail; like this qdbus org.kde.kmail /KMail org.kde.kmail.kmail.folderList. You can use qdbusviewer to browse available methods in a graphical interface.
When I reply to a message only a part of the message is quoted. How come?
This can happen when the message contains two dashes and a space on a single line. This is seen as the start of the signature. The remaining part of the message will not be quoted because when you reply to a message kmail; strips the signature.
I am only using imap; can I get rid of those Local Folders in the folder list or at least keep them collapsed all the time?
Although kmail; can be considered reliable you should keep backups of your messages ie; use one of the export/archive options listed in Backup Options to backup your settings and email to a safe place.
kmail; is capable of importing email in several formats from your previous email applications using options in Restore and Import in kmail;.
Organize your folders with ease using kmail;s extensive Folders options. Some of the features include handling per folder mailing lists acl (imap; only) and archiving.
Compliment your folder setup with highly configurable filters.
By default kmail; will detect common email scams. You can also fight SPAM and viruses with built in wizards to work with external programs to scan email as it comes in. See Anti Spam Wizard and Anti-Virus-Wizard for details.
Uses a fixed width (Monospace) font to display the messages in the current folder. The font to be used can be configured in the Fonts tab on the Appearance page of the kmail; configuration dialog.
Lets you choose the character encoding to be used in the Message Pane. The default Auto should work in almost all cases.

To activate the toolbar select Settings Toolbars Shown Navigator.
kontact;'s Navigator toolbar.
A special action common to all components is the New action. It allows creation of new objects including emails contacts appointments and to-dos independently of which component is active. The component responsible for processing the selected object is started if required and takes over the created object.

Fill in the date in Archive now items older than field or use the Calendar Widget to choose the date. Alternatively you can automatically archive all items older than a certain period of time.
If you have chosen archiving you must also provide a filename for the archive in the Archive File field. If you want to re-use an older archive file press the Open file dialog button and find an existing archive. The entries will be added to the file so any item already in the file will not be modified.
Archiving will keep all old items in a file including completed to-dos. But if you do not want to keep completed to-dos at all choose the FilePurge Completed To-dos  menu item to remove all the completed to-dos from your active resources. If you want to keep your completed to-dos but do not wish to view them in the to-do lists consider filtering them out instead of purging them.
Downloading Using Get Hot New Stuff
To open the Get Hot New Stuff dialog which offers a list of calendars to download choose the FileImport Get Hot New Stuff menu item. If you select one of the calendars a dialog with the list of events from the calendars will appear. To merge the displayed events with your default resource press Merge.
Select Request Response from the drop down box if this attendee should respond to your schedule plan. Consequently the attendee will be emailed with the event schedule information. A small envelope will appear in the details list to indicate this. This feature is specially useful when groupware scheduling is enabled as the attendee's status is updated automatically.
Reminder Tab
Select a default reminder in the drop down box and press Add if korganizer; should remind you about an event.
Use the Configure button to open the Edit existing reminder dialog. Using this dialog you can choose how many minutes hours or days before or after the events start or end you want to be reminded you can set repeating intervals for your reminders and create special reminders that display text send emails play sounds or run programs and scripts.
If you select to run a specific program or script at the reminder time make sure however that you have sufficient rights to run that program; if you do not the program will not run.
korganizer; Configuration
To change korganizer;'s look and behavior choose the SettingsConfigure korganizer; menu item. You can get more information about all the configure options and possibilities in .
To customize the set of tools available on the bar choose the SettingsConfigure Toolbars  menu item and read the Section Customizing Toolbars in the kde; Fundamentals.
Localization information like date and time formats can be configured from systemsettings; within the modules Language and Formats. These control modules can be accessed from within korganizer; just choose the  SettingsConfigure Date amp; Time menu item. korganizer; has to be restarted for changes done in systemsettings; to take effect.
To configure where korganizer; stores and retrieves calendar events journal entries and to-dos (in local files groupware servers etc;) please check .
By retrieving other people's free/busy information you can take their busy time schedule into account when inviting them to an event.
Automate the process for retrieving other users free/busy time. Fill in the server information section below to enable this option.
This setting lets you change the name of the file which will be fetched from the server. If you check this option it will download a free/busy file called user@domain.ifb else it will fetch user.ifb. Ask the server administrator if you are not sure about how to configure this option.
Kolab2 server specificity If you are configuring korganizer; as a component to a kde; Kolab client (kontact;/Kolab) you have to check this option.
Enter the URL; for the server from which your Free/Busy information will be fetched. Ask the server administrator for this information.
You can get a detailed description of the event window in the Entering Events section.
Actions New To-do
Choose New To-do to create a new to-do. Initially the to-do has no due date but you can specify one.
You can get a detailed description of the to-do window in the Entering To-dos section.
Actions New Sub-to-do
By default the number of log lines that are kept in the history is limited to 10000 lines. You can configure the history size in the configuration dialog.
Saving the Contents of the Log Window to a File
Sometimes it might be convenient to save the current log window contents to a file eg; to mail it to the developers as part of a bug report. There are two ways to achieve this in kwatchgnupg;
First you can choose FileSave As (or the corresponding toolbar icon) to save the complete log window contents to a file. You will be prompted to specify a save file location.
Second you can select the interesting lines with normal left-mouse selection and paste them into a word processor or mail user agent just like any other text. You should make sure though that lines are not broken since this reduces the readability of the log.

The text in this section expects that you have read the chapter on what a regular expression is or have previous knowledge on this subject.
All the editing tools are located in the toolbar above editing area. Each of them will be described in the following.
The selection tool is used to mark elements for cut-and-paste and drag-and-drop. This is very similar to a selection tool in any drawing program.
Using this tool you will insert normal text to match. The text is matched literally ie; you do not have to worry about escaping of special characters. In the example above the following regular expression will be build abc\*\\\)

KiCad Workflow
Despite its similarities with other PCB software tools KiCad is characterised by an interesting work-flow in which schematic components and footprints are actually two separate entities. This is often the subject of discussion on Internet forums.
The *.xsl file is located in plugins directory of the KiCad installation which is located at /usr/lib/kicad/plugins/.
Or get the file via
wget https//raw.githubusercontent.com/KiCad/kicad-source-mirror/master/eeschema/plugins/bom2csv.xsl
KiCad automatically generates the command for example
You may want to add the extension so change this command line to
Sometimes a component that you want to place on your schematic is not in a KiCad library. This is quite normal and there is no reason to worry. In this section we will see how a new schematic component can be quickly created with KiCad. Nevertheless remember that you can always find KiCad components on the Internet. For instance from here
http//per.launay.free.fr/kicad/kicadphp/composant.php
In KiCad a component is a piece of text that starts with a 'DEF' and ends with 'ENDDEF'. One or more components are normally placed in a library file with the extension .lib. If you want to add components to a library file you can just use the cut and paste commands.
Using Component Library Editor
We can use the Component Library Editor (part of Eeschema)  to make new components. In our project folder 'tutorial1' let's create a folder named 'library'. Inside we will put our new library file myLib.lib as soon as we have created our new component.

fundamentalssubroutinesvariables;global and localmodules;subroutines and functions
This section provides the fundamentals for working with $[officename] Basic.
$[officename] Basic code is based on subroutines and functions that are specified between subend¬†sub and functionend¬†function sections. Each Sub or Function can call other Subs and Functions. If you take care to write generic code for a Sub or Function you can probably re-use it in other programs. See also Procedures and Functions.
Some restrictions apply for the names of your public variables subs and functions. You must not use the same name as one of the modules of the same library.
What is a Sub?
Parameters can be passed to a SUB or a FUNCTION either by reference or by value. Unless otherwise specified a parameter is always passed by reference. That means that a SUB or a FUNCTION gets the parameter and can read and modify its value.
If you want to pass a parameter by value insert the key word "ByVal" in front of the parameter when you call a SUB or FUNCTION for example
Result = Function(ByVal Parameter)
In this case the original content of the parameter will not be modified by the FUNCTION since it only gets the value and not the parameter itself.

You can use the TimeSerial function to convert any time into a single value that you can use to calculate time differences.
The TimeSerial function returns the type Variant with VarType 7 (Date). This value is stored internally as a double-precision number between 0 and 0.9999999999. As opposed to the DateSerial or DateValue function where the serial date values are calculated as days relative to a fixed date you can calculate with values returned by the TimeSerial function but you cannot evaluate them.
Expression1 Expression2 Any expressions that you want to compare.
When testing for equivalence between Boolean expressions the result is True if both expressions are either True or False.
In a bit-wise comparison the Eqv operator only sets the corresponding bit in the result if a bit is set in both expressions or in neither expression.
vOut = A > B Eqv B > C ' returns -1
vOut = B > A Eqv B > C ' returns 0

Returns the (trigonometric) tangent of Number the angle in radians.
To return the tangent of an angle in degrees use the RADIANS function.
You can also create a "normal" formula in which the reference range such as parameters indicate an array formula. The result is obtained from the intersection of the reference range and the rows or columns in which the formula is found. If there is no intersection or if the range at the intersection covers several rows or columns a #VALUE! error message appears. The following example illustrates this concept
Creating Array Formulas
If you create an array formula using the Function Wizard you must mark the Array check box each time so that the results are returned in an array. Otherwise only the value in the upper-left cell of the array being calculated is returned.
If you enter the array formula directly into the cell you must use the key combination Shift+CommandCtrl+Enter instead of the Enter key. Only then does the formula become an array formula.
Array formulas appear in braces in $[officename] Calc. You cannot create array formulas by manually entering the braces.

For grouped option fields the status of the group corresponding to the default setting is defined by the Default Status property.
Specifies the list box entry to mark as the default entry. Specifies the list box entry to mark as the default entry.
For a Reset type button the Default selection entry defines the status of the list box if the reset button is activated by the user.
For a List box that contains a value list you can click the  button to open the Default selection dialog.
For combo boxes an SQL statement may take the following form
SELECT DISTINCT field FROM table
Here "field" is a data field from the list table "table" whose content is displayed in the list of the combo box.
Value lists for HTML documents
For HTML forms you can enter a value list under List content. Select the option "Valuelist" under Type of list contents. The values entered here will not be visible in the form and are used to assign values to the visible entries. The entries made under List content correspond to the HTML tag .
On the Events tab page you can link macros to events that occur in a form's control fields.
Depending on the control different events are available. Only the available events for the selected control and context are listed on the Events tab page. The following events are defined
This event takes place before an action is triggered by clicking the control. For example clicking a "Submit" button initiates a send action; however the actual "send" process is started only when the When initiating event occurs. The Approve action event allows you to kill the process. If the linked method sends back FALSE When initiating will not be executed.
The Execute action event occurs when an action is started. For example if you have a "Submit" button in your form the send process represents the action to be initiated.
The Changed event takes place when the control loses the focus and the content of the control has changed since it lost the focus.

 Determines if the data can be modified.
Determines if the data can be deleted.
If you create a subform enter the data field of the parent form responsible for the synchronization between parent and subform. To enter multiple values press Shift + Enter after each input line.
The subform is based on an SQL query; more specifically on a Parameter Query. If a field name is entered in the Link master fields box the data contained in that field in the main form is read to a variable that you must enter in Link slave fields. In an appropriate SQL statement this variable is compared to the table data that the subform refers to. Alternatively you can enter the column name in the Link master fields box.
The field name given here appears in the Control properties as an element of an SQL statement in the List Contents field.
List Box Wizard Field Link
Indicates through which fields tables of values and list tables are linked.
The value table is the table of the current form where the list field is inserted. The list table is the table whose data is to be shown in the list field. Both tables must be linked over a mutual data field. These links are to be entered on this page of the wizard. The field names must not necessarily be the same (this depends upon how the field names are defined in both tables) but both fields must have the same field type.

The Query Design View allows you to create and edit a database query.
Most databases use queries to filter or to sort database tables to display records on your computer. Views offer the same functionality as queries but on the server side. If your database is on a server that supports views you can use views to filter the records on the server to speed up the display time.
Selecting the Create View command from the Tables tab page of a database document you see the View Design window that resembles the Query Design window described here.
The Query Design window layout is stored with a created query but cannot be stored with a created view.
Formulating filter conditions
When formulating filter conditions various operators and commands are available to you. Apart from the relational operators there are SQL-specific commands that query the content of database fields. If you use these commands in the $[officename] syntax $[officename] automatically converts these into the corresponding SQL syntax. You can also enter the SQL command directly. The following tables give an overview of the operators and commands
Condition is satisfied if
the content of the field is identical to the indicated expression.
The operator = will not be displayed in the query fields. If you enter a value without any operator the operator = will be automatically adopted.
Inner Join
With the internal join the results table contains only the records for which the content of the linked fields is the same. In $[officename] SQL this type of link is created by a corresponding WHERE clause.
Left Join
With the left join the results table contains all fields of the left table and only those fields of the right table for which the content of the linked fields is the same. In $[officename] SQL this type of link corresponds to the LEFT OUTER JOIN command.
Right Join
If you opened the Relations dialog for an existing relation by double-clicking the connection lines in the Relation window then the tables involved in the relation cannot be modified.
Key fields
Defines the key fields for the relation.
The names of the tables selected for the link appear here as column names. If you click a field you can use the arrow buttons to select a field from the table. Each relation is written in a row.
Here you can select options that take effect when there are changes to a primary key field.
Only allows names that use characters that conform to the SQL92 naming constraints in the data source. All other characters are rejected. Each name must begin with a lower or upper case letter or an underline (  ). The remaining characters can be ASCII letters underlines and numbers.
Use Catalog for file-based databases
Uses the current data source of the Catalog. This is useful when the ODBC data source is a database server. If the ODBC data source is a dBASE driver leave this check box clear.
Specify the settings for a dBASE database.
To be able to define relations between tables use JDBC or ODBC from within $[officename].
Path to dBASE files
Enter the path to the directory that contains the dBASE files.
Ensure that the *.dbf file name extension of the dBASE files is lowercase.
Opens a dialog where you can select a file or a directory.

Vertical stack (3 elements)
Brackets do not adjust their size to the enclosed expression. For example if you want "( a over b )" with a bracket size adjusted to a and b you must insert "left" and "right". Entering "left(a over b right)" produces appropriate sizing. If however the brackets themselves are part of the expression whose size is changed they are included the size change "size 3(a over b)" and "size 12(a over b)". The sizing of the bracket-to-expression ratio does not change in any way.
Since "left" and "right" ensure unique assignment of the brackets every single bracket can be used as an argument for these two commands even placing right brackets on the left side or left brackets on the right. Instead of a bracket you can use the "none" qualifier which means that there is no bracket shown and that there is no space reserved for a bracket. Using this you can create the following expressions
left lbrace x right none

User variables
Styles that are used in subdocuments such as new paragraph styles are automatically imported into the master document.
When viewing the master document styles that are already present in the master document take precedence over styles with the same name that are imported from subdocuments.
Subdocuments never get changed by changes made to the master document.
When you add a document to a master document or create a new subdocument a link is created in the master document. You cannot edit the content of a subdocument directly in the master document but you can use the Navigator to open any subdocument for edit.
Example of Using Styles
You must enable this feature by removing the check mark from menu View - Hidden Paragraphs. When the check mark is set you cannot hide any paragraph.
To Hide a Section
Select the text that you want to hide in your document.
In the Hide area select Hide and then enter an expression in the Condition box. For example using the variable you previously defined enter Hide==1.

If you are using another operating system you can use `Kiwiirc ` to connect to the chat room.
Many people are connected to the chat room but only look at it now and then. Be patient after asking a question. Don't repeat it and stay connected until you get an answer. It can sometimes take a few hours for somebody to see your question and reply to you. Don't quit after a few minutes. It is frustrating to you but also to others who later see your question and are unable to reply because you already left.
If you are using Hexchat you can minimize it to tray by clicking its status icon. People will often mention your nickname when replying to you. When they do your Hexchat status icon will blink to catch your attention.

--command-line-charset character-set
Sets the character set to convert strings given on the command line from. It defaults to the character set given by system's current locale.
--output-charset character-set
Sets the character set to which strings are converted that are to be output.  It defaults to the character set given by system's current locale.
These will be extracted to raw MP3 files.
AOPUS
Opus tracks are written to OggOpus files.
APCM/INT/LIT APCM/INT/BIG
Raw PCM data will be written to a WAV file. Big-endian integer data will be converted to little-endian data in the process.
Merge multimedia streams into a matroska; file
mkvmerge global options -o out options1 file1  options2 file2  @options-file.json
This program takes the input from several media files and joins their streams (all of them or just a selection) into a matroska; file; see the matroska; website.
The order of command line options is important. Please read the section quot;Option orderquot; if you're new to the program.
-q --quiet
Normally each range will be written to a new file. This can be changed so that consecutive ranges are written to the same file. For that the user has to prefix the start timestamp with a +. This tells mkvmerge; not to create a new file and instead append the range to the same file the previous range was written to. Timestamps will be adjusted so that there will be no gap in the output file even if there was a gap in the two ranges in the input file.
In example 1 mkvmerge; will create two files. The first will contain the content starting from 000120 until 000245. The second file will contain the content starting from 000550 until 001030.
In example 2 mkvmerge; will create only one file. This file will contain both the content starting from 000120 until 000245 and the content starting from 000550 until 001030.
In example 3 mkvmerge; will create two files. The first will contain the content from the start of the source files until 000245. The second file will contain the content starting from 000550 until the end of the source files.
Note that mkvmerge; only makes decisions about splitting at key frame positions. This applies to both the start and the end of each range. So even if an end timestamp is between two key frames mkvmerge; will continue outputting the frames up to but excluding the following key frame.
Don't copy attachments from this file.
--no-global-tags
Don't copy global tags from this file.
Sets the charset that is used for the conversion to UTF-8 for chapter information contained in the source file. See the section about  text files and character sets for an explanation how mkvmerge; converts between character sets.
Sets the ISO639-2 language code that is written for each chapter entry.  This option can be used for source files that contain chapters but no information about the chapters' languages e.g. for MP4 and OGM files.
--projection-pose-roll TIDfloat
--field-order TIDn
Sets the field order for the video track with the track ID TID.  The order must be one of the following numbers
0 progressive; 1 interlaced with top field displayed first and top field stored first; 2 undetermined field order; 6 interlaced with bottom field displayed first and bottom field stored first; 9 interlaced with bottom field displayed first and top field stored first; 14 interlaced with top field displayed first and bottom field stored first
--stereo-mode TIDn|keyword
This section applies to all programs in MKVToolNix even if it only mentions mkvmerge;.
All text in a matroska; file is encoded in UTF-8. This means that mkvmerge; has to convert every text file it reads as well as every text given on the command line from one character set into UTF-8. In return this also means that mkvmerge;'s output has to be converted back to that character set from UTF-8 e.g. if a non-English translation is used with --ui-language or for text originating from a matroska; file.
mkvmerge; does this conversion automatically based on the presence of a byte order marker (short BOM) or the system's current locale. How the character set is inferred from the locale depends on the operating system that mkvmerge; is run on.
Byte order markers (BOM)
Text files that start with a BOM are already encoded in one representation of UTF. mkvmerge; supports the following five modes UTF-8 UTF-16 Little and Big Endian UTF-32 Little and Big Endian. Text files with a BOM are automatically converted to UTF-8. Any of the parameters that would otherwise set the character set for such a file (e.g. --sub-charset) is silently ignored.
Timestamp files that are used when tracks are appended to each other must only be specified for the first part in a chain of tracks.  For example if you append two files v1.avi and v2.avi and want to use timestamps then your command line must look something like this
$ mkvmerge  --timestamps 0mytimestamps.txt v1.avi +v2.avi
There are four formats that are recognized by mkvmerge;. The first line always contains the version number. Empty lines lines containing only whitespace and lines beginning with '#' are ignored.
Timestamp file format v1
This format starts with the version line. The second line declares the default number of frames per second.  All following lines contain three numbers separated by commas the start frame (0 is the first frame) the end frame and the number of frames in this range. The FPS is a floating point number with the dot '.' as the decimal point. The ranges can contain gaps for which the default FPS is used. An example
$ mkvpropedit movie.mkv --chapters new-chapters.xml
Removing all chapters requires leaving out the file name
$ mkvpropedit movie.mkv --chapters ''
Adding a font file (Arial.ttf) as an attachment
$ mkvpropedit movie.mkv --add-attachment Arial.ttf

Add an all.rdz boot image
To boot through the network the networked computer needs a boot image. Morever we need to name this image so each boot image is related to a name in the PXE menu. Thus the user can choose which image he wants to boot through PXE.
For technical reasons in case of multiple boot images it's simpler to boot the networked computer through a kernel (vmlinuz) and to provide one file with all needed drivers (in our case all.rdz).

Mageia 4 is supported by the Mageia.org nonprofit organisation which is  governed by a body of recognized and elected contributors.
Mageia 4 has been made by more than 100 people from all around the world.
Our work adds to the excellent work of the wider Linux and Free Software community. We aim to blend all the excellent work done by the community adding the special Mageia ingredients to bring you the best most stable reliable and enjoyable experience we can make for regular users developers and businesses.
We welcome new contributors to any of the many different teams that go to make up Mageia the Community and we encourage you to join us.
Sorry we could not find this page.
Mageia is a pragmatic community.
We value tangible results over having the last word in a discussion. We defend our core values like freedom and respectful collaboration but we don't let arguments about minor issues get in the way of achieving more important results. We are open to suggestions and welcome solutions regardless of their origin. When in doubt support a solution which helps getting things done over one which has theoretical merits but isn't being implemented. Use the tools and methods which help get the job done. Let decisions be made by those who do the work. If some issues arise that seem irreconcilable consult the relevant team leader. If necessary the Mageia Council may be consulted.
Support others in the community.
Our community is made strong by mutual respect collaboration and responsible pragmatic behaviour. Sometimes these values have to be defended and other community members may need help.
If you witness others being attacked think first about how you can offer them personal support. If you feel that the situation is beyond your ability to help individually go privately to the victim and ask if some form of official intervention is needed. Similarly you should support anyone who appears to be in danger of burning out either through work-related stress or personal problems.
We will work in collaboration with other open source projects.
We will welcome any Commercial Enterprise as part of our community.
Mageia will always be based upon Open Source Software. However it will also be open to non-OSS contributions to provide alternatives for our users' diverse needs and expectations.
Mageia will always be a collective international and organised endeavor representative of our pluralistic community.

You can then modify the XML file it creates (or any of the ones that ship with Mixxx) if you'd like to fine-tune it or add more presets. For more information go to ``.
The Controller Wizard works only for term`MIDI` devices. Currently you can't map modifier (shift) keys and platter rotations. Use ref`MIDI Scripting ` instead.

--controllerDebug
Causes Mixxx to display/log all controller data it receives and script functions it loads.
--developer
Enables developer-mode. Includes extra log info stats on performance a Developer tools menu extra developer skins and provides useful information for skin writers in widget tooltips and logs .
Audio API
The Audio term`API` that Mixxx uses is the method by which Mixxx talks to your term`Operating System` in order to deliver audio to your soundcard. Your choice of Audio API can drastically affect Mixxx's performance on your computer. **Therefore it is important to take care to choose the best Audio API available to you.** Refer to the following table of Audio APIs to see what the best choice is for your operating system.
OS / Audio API
Windows / WMME
Windows / DirectSound
Using the Mouse drag/wheel on the waveforms you can adjust zoom and playback rate of the tracks. For more information go to ref`interface-waveform`.
Using a Keyboard
Mixxx Keyboard shortcuts (for en-us keyboard layout)
download`Download the image `
Controlling Mixxx with a keyboard is handy. Unlike mouse control the keyboard allows you to manage things simultaneously. For example you can start playing a track on deck 1 whilst stopping deck 2 at the same time.
Auto DJ allows you to automatically load tracks from the Auto DJ playlist when the current track is nearly finished and crossfade into it.  See ref`library-auto-dj`.
Loading tracks into Auto DJ
To play tracks automatically they must first be loaded into the Auto DJ playlist. The Auto DJ playlist is empty by default.
Mixxx library - Adding a playlist to Auto DJ
There are several ways to load tracks into the Auto DJ playlist
**4 Decks** Each deck features a scratchable scrolling waveform that marks beats and cue points along with a whole-song waveform overview for quick seeking.
**Advanced Controls** Change playback with time stretching and loop beat segments.
**Sampler Decks** Perfect for dropping that vocal sample or airhorn.
**External Library Integration** Use your playlists and songs from iTunes Traktor Rhythmbox and Banshee.
**BPM Detection and Sync** Instantly detect and sync the tempo of your songs.
Make sure the guilabel`Rating` column is not hidden. Rate tracks by hovering over the rating field and clicking the stars.
**Track Inline editing**
Mixxx reads term`metadata` from the tracks to fill the columns of the library. Double-click on a field edit the data and hit kbd`Enter` when you are done. Go to the chapter ref`edit metadata ` for detailed information.
**Loading tracks**
To load a track into a ref`deck ` you can either drag it to the waveform display or use the context menu. Go to the chapter ref`djing-loading-tracks` for detailed information.
Mixxx reads relevant term`metadata` from the tracks and displays them in the library columns. You are free to edit most metadata and Mixxx offers a number of different ways to do so. Note that some information can not be edited such as bitrate size length type filename and location.
Mixxx does not support editing the metadata of many tracks at a time (bulk editing).
Changes to a track's metadata will be saved to the Mixxx library but **not** to the track itself. Mixxx wont touch your audio files to prevent data loss.
Double-click on a field in the ref`library `. If the field is editable it will become an editable text box. Enter a value and hit kbd`Enter` when you are done.
Mixxx library - Inline editing
**Join with previous** Join the current history session with a previous one.
**Export playlist** Export a session in various file formats ideal for processing the data in other applications.
Analyze - Prepare your tracks
This section allows you to analyze your tracks in advance of loading them into a deck. Analyzing tracks requires considerably CPU power and may cause skips in the audio while performing so it helps to have your tracks analyzed before you play. See ref`library-analyze` for details.
iTunes Traktor Rhythmbox Banshee - Using external libraries
Activate MP3 streaming support on Linux
On Ubuntu and GNU/Linux-based operating systems MP3 streams can be activated by installing the package file`libmp3lame`. Dependent on your Linux distribution the package might be slightly named different such as file`lame`.
If you're new to DJing this is the section for you. We've got some tutorials for you that cover the basics of DJing with Mixxx. If you already you already know how to DJ and are just looking for an overview of how to get your groove on with Mixxx you can skip to the `Table of Contents`.
Example of a note
Example of a warning
cueing
Headphone cueing or just cueing is listening to the next track you would like to mix in in your headphones. The audience will not hear what you are cueing in your headphones. Being able to cue is a crucial aspect to DJing.
db
Short for decibels. A Decibel is a logarithmic measurement of sound level. Whispering is around 25 dB while unbearable sound such as a jet engine is around 160 db. Rule of thumb A volume increase of 10 dB is perceived as twice as loud.
deck
A deck with a track loaded
The deck section allows you to control everything relating to a virtual turntable term`deck`. We are going to break this down into sections.
Track Information Display
The track information section of the deck
Parse the title and the artist from the file name when the corresponding term`metadata` is missing.
**Loop roll** Right-click on any of the numbered loop buttons to temporarily setup a rolling loop over the defined number of beats. Playback will resume where the track would have been if it had not entered the loop.
**Double loop** Clicking on the plus button will double the current loop's length up to 64 bars. The length of the loop overlay in the waveform will increase accordingly.
**Halve loop** Clicking on the minus button will halve the current loop's length down to 1/32 bars. The length of the loop overlay in the waveform will decrease accordingly.
**Loop Buttons**
**Loop-In** This button allow you to manually set the start point of a loop. A loop-in marker is placed on the waveform indicating the position. If clicked when a loop was already set it moves the start point of a loop to a new position.
**Denon mode**
**After track load** Track is paused.
Holding down the Cue button plays the track from the Cue point as long as the button is pressed. After releasing the Cue button the track jumps back to Cue point and pauses again. Continue playback by pressing the Play/Pause button before releasing the Cue button.
Tapping the Play/Pause button starts the track at the current position.
**While paused not at Cue point (Play button flashing)**
**Sound inputs**
It is recommended to use a proper DJ sound card that has **multiple** stereo line inputs on it.
Alternatively you can use multiple sound cards each with a single stereo line in but this is strongly discouraged.
Mixxx supports vinyl control input through a single soundcard with at least 4-channels of input (two stereo line-in jacks) or through multiple separate soundcards which each have 2-channels of input (a single stereo line-in jack). Vinyl control requires the use of stereo line-in jacks - Mono or microphone inputs will not work.
It is strongly recommended to use a soundcard that comes with native low latency drivers such as ASIO (Windows) or CoreAudio (Mac). Linux users depend on the quality of the corresponding open source driver.
|tooquiet|
Timecode signal too quiet. Mixxx receives a signal which has not enough amplification.
Boost the amplification either on your external Mixer soundcard or with the `Turntable Input Preamp`

Moodle can use an additional level of security when accepting data from web forms. If this is enabled then the browser's HTTPREFERER variable is checked against the current form address.  In a very few cases this can cause problems if the user is using a firewall (eg Zonealarm) configured to strip HTTPREFERER from their web traffic.  Symptoms are getting 'stuck' on a form. If your users are having problems with the login page (for example) you might want to disable this setting although it might leave your site more open to brute-force password attacks.  If in doubt leave this set to 'Yes'.
This setting customises the name of the cookie used for Moodle sessions.  This is optional and only useful to avoid cookies being confused when there is more than one copy of Moodle running within the same web site.
This allows you to change the domain that the Moodle cookies are available from. This is useful for Moodle customisations (e.g. authentication or enrolment plugins) that need to share Moodle session information with a web application on another subdomain. WARNING it is strongly recommended to leave this setting at the default (empty) - an incorrect value will prevent all logins to the site.
If you need to change where browsers send the Moodle cookies you can change this setting to specify a subdirectory of your web site.  Otherwise the default '/' should be fine.

If enabled the available update for Moodle code is also reported when a new build for the current version is available. Builds are continuous improvements of a given Moodle version.

A new feature has been added in Moodle 1.5 to track read/unread forum posts.  To use this functionality you need to update your tables with all the tracking information for existing posts.  Depending on the size of your site this can take a long time (hours) and can be quite taxing on the database so it's best to do it during a quiet period.  However your site will continue functioning during this upgrade and users won't be affected.  Once you start this process you should let it finish (keep your browser window open).  However if you stop the process by closing the window don't worry you can start over.Do you want to start the upgrading process now?

There are many different ways of advancing the principles of the Mozilla Manifesto. We welcome a broad range of activities and anticipate the same creativity that Mozilla participants have shown in other areas of the project. For individuals not deeply involved in the Mozilla project one basic and very effective way to support the Manifesto is to use Mozilla Firefox and other products that embody the principles of the Manifesto.
The renewed competition has accelerated innovation and improved the Internet for everyone.
There‚Äôs no guarantee that the Internet will remain open or enjoyable or safe.
These are the principles that guide our mission to promote openness innovation  opportunity on the web.

QGIS is open source software. This means that the software source code can be freely viewed and modified. The GPL places a restriction that any modifications you make must be made available in source form to whoever you give modified versions to and that you can not create a new version of QGIS under a 'closed source' license. Visit  the QGIS home page (https//qgis.org) for more information.
Would you like to see QGIS in your native language? We are looking for more translators and would appreciate your help! The translation process is fairly straight forward - instructions are available in the QGIS wiki translator's page.
In the Print Composer you can rotate a map by setting its rotation value in the tab Item Properties -> Map -> Main properties section. To place a north arrow in your layout you can use the Add Image tool. After the selection and placement of the north arrow in the layout you can link it with a specific map frame by activating the Sync with map checkbox and selecting a map frame. Whenever you change the rotation value of a linked map the north arrow will now automatically adjust its rotation.

Shaders are like filters for the game rendering. You can select a shader set here which is a collection of shaders selected for each system. You can also change the shader within the game with HOTKEY + L2 or HOTKEY + R2.
Enable or disable RetroAchievements in games.
Hardcore mode disables *all* savestate and rewind functions within the emulator you will not be able to save and reload at any time. You will have to complete the game and get the achievements first time just like on the original console. In reward for this you will earn both the standard and the hardcore achievement in effect earning double points! A regular game worth 400 points is now worth 800 if you complete it on hardcore! For example if you complete the game for 400 points you then have the opportunity to earn another 400 on hardcore.

Answer Point
Points are given per item. The overall point score for the question is automatically calculated from the sum of the item points.
The theme describes the main topic/domain that the item set will address and is linked to the learning objectives.  A more generic theme (such as "Diarrhoea") may be used for sampling knowledge over wider fields and items in that set may include pharmacology epidemiology and investigations. A more focussed theme (such as "Management of diarrhoea") is used to sample in-depth knowledge in this case all related to pharmacology.
The options list consists of the potential answer choices to the item and includes the distracters that are the incorrect or less likely answers for this particular item. The options should be homogenous or "the same kind of thing" such as drugs organisms cells or investigations and should be listed only as words or short phrases. Options that are unnecessarily complicated (combinations of options) or "all/none of the above" are not allowed.
The lead-in statement specifies the association between the stem and the option list. In the R-type format the options list (for example 8 or more potential diagnoses) is summarized in the lead-in statement for example "For each of the following patients presenting to the Emergency Room select the most likely diagnosis." The lead-in should provide clear instructions how the student should respond to the item set.

Separation Name
A way of switching off some of the gray shades which are composed of cyan yellow and magenta and using black instead. UCR most affects parts of images which are neutral and/or dark tones which are close to the gray. Use of this may improve printing some images and some experimentation and testing is need on a case by case basis. UCR reduces the possibility of over saturation with CMY inks.

Enabling the image cache will significantly speed up the loading of images. Enable the cache if you are often working on large documents with lots of images and if you have plenty of disk space in your application data directory.
Set the level of compression for images in the cache. Higher values result in smaller cache files but also make writes to the cache slower.

How can I donate to Tor Project?
* Locate your Tor Browser folder or application.
The Tor network has over a million daily users and just over 6000 relays to route all of their traffic and the load on each server can sometimes cause latency.
The low/default setting allows Javascript but the medium and high levels both block Javascript on HTTP sites.
You can access these websites by using Tor Browser.

To use GetTor via Twitter.
* Run "service tor reload" (as root).
Tor Browser prevents people from knowing the websites you visit.
If the outcome you want is simply to be able to access resources that are only available in one country you may want to consider using a VPN instead of using Tor.

Sometimes websites will block Tor users because they can't tell the difference between the average Tor user and automated traffic.

Most antivirus or malware protection allows the user to "whitelist" certain processes that would otherwise be blocked.

If you are running an anti-virus please see My antivirus/malware protection is blocking me from accessing Tor Browser it is common for anti-virus / anti-malware software to cause this type of issue.
We don't want to encourage people to use paths longer than this as it increases load on the network without (as far as we can tell) providing any more security.

About ExoneraTor
The URL bar
Tor Browser centers your web experience around your relationship with the website in the URL bar. Even if you connect to two different sites that use the same third-party tracking service Tor Browser will force the content to be served over two different Tor circuits so the tracker will not know that both connections originate from your browser.
On the other hand all connections to a single website address will be made over the same Tor circuit meaning you can browse different pages of a single website in separate tabs or windows without any loss of functionality.
external ref='media/managing-identities/circuitfull.png' md5='bd46d22de952fee42643be46d3f95928'
You can see a diagram of the circuit that Tor Browser is using for the current tab in the onion menu.
Delete the Tor Browser folder.
Empty your Trash
Note that your operating system‚Äôs standard ‚ÄúUninstall‚Äù utility is not used.
How to update Tor Browser
Tor Browser must be kept updated at all times. If you continue to use an outdated version of the software you may be vulnerable to serious security flaws that compromise your privacy and anonymity.

Welcome to VLC media player HelpDocumentationYou can find VLC documentation on VideoLAN's wiki website.If you are a newcomer to VLC media player please read theIntroduction to VLC media player.You will find some information on how to use the player in the "How to play files with VLC media player" document.For all the saving converting transcoding encoding muxing and streaming tasks you should find useful information in the Streaming Documentation.If you are unsure about terminology please consult the knowledge base.To understand the main keyboard shortcuts read the shortcuts page.HelpBefore asking any question please refer yourself to the FAQ.You might then get (and give) help on the Forums the mailing-lists or our IRC channel (#videolan on irc.freenode.net).Contribute to the projectYou can help the VideoLAN project giving some of your time to help the community to design skins to translate the documentation to test and to code. You can also give funds and material to help us. And of course you can promote VLC media player.
Audio filtering failed
S/PDIF can be used by default when your hardware supports it as well as the audio stream being played.
Force detection of Dolby Surround
Use this when you know your stream is (or is not) encoded with Dolby Surround but fails to be detected as such. Even if the stream is not actually encoded with Dolby Surround turning on this option might enhance your experience especially when combined with the Headphone Channel Mixer.
Stereo audio output mode
This adds audio post processing filters to modify the sound rendering.
This enables handling of mouse clicks on the video.
These options allow you to modify the behavior of the input subsystem such as the DVD or VCD device the network interface settings or the subtitle channel.
File caching (ms)
Caching value for local files in milliseconds.
Live capture caching (ms)
RTSP server address
This defines the address the RTSP server will listen on along with the base path of the RTSP VOD media. Syntax is address/path. By default the server will listen on any local IP address. Specify an IP address (e.g. 1 or 127.0.0.1) or a host name (e.g. localhost) to restrict them to a specific network interface.
HTTP server port
The HTTP server will listen on this TCP port. The standard HTTP port number is 80. However allocation of port numbers below 1025 is usually restricted by the operating system.
HTTPS server port
Use only one instance when started from file manager
Increase the priority of the process
Increasing the priority of the process will very likely improve your playing experience as it allows VLC not to be disturbed by other applications that could otherwise take too much processor time. However be advised that in certain circumstances (bugs) VLC could take all the processor time and render the whole system unresponsive which might require a reboot of your machine.

When using the one instance only option enqueue items to playlist and keep playing current item.

End Scenario
Recruiting
Valley of Trolls
Next morning the elves set off again increasingly wearied by the hardships of the campaign and longing for the green comfort of their home forests. This land was barren and rugged; nothing shielded them from biting northern wind as they traveled towards the mountains looming before them.
At dusk they arrived at the mouth of a valley cutting almost straight through the range and made camp as scouts warned that the area was hostile and the road ahead treacherous in darkness. There were no songs or music that night and most of the elves slept uneasily. An unlucky few kept a cautious watch.
When sunrise came the elves moved into battle formations. Whatever waited in the slopes ahead it would not find them unprepared.

Look goblin riders approach! You were right they were going to raid Dallben while we were gone.
We must stop them before they reach the village. Damn the crown they have long since forgotten about us out here.
We are barely able to survive these orc raids. We lost two men last week more today yet Weldyn does nothing!
The King stopped sending patrols out here once the war started. Once that happened the burden fell to us. We are citizens of Wesnoth and as long as her banner flies we will resist the horde.
So now you need to defend your rear as well as your front I see your predicament. My men will wipe this land clean if you can help us defend our homeland.
The lich is destroyed and its minions dead.
With the undead driven out we may live here in relative peace and pursue our studies. For this Baldras I am grateful.
Studies? Peace? You mean to continue feeding on the lawful citizens of Wesnoth. There will be no peace for them.
I was planning on giving you gold. Any good army is well financed and with the lich gone we can now spare it.
Few humans fathom the secrets of light and dark magic and retain their sanity. Those that can master that balance become Shadow Lords fully existing neither in the world of light nor the world of darkness.

By then their leader will have recruited more units to send against us and the real fight will begin.
See this dark blue water? It‚Äôs too deep for either side to cross. The orcs could slowly wade through that narrow band of shallow lighter-blue water in the east; but we could stand on the shore and force them to fight us from the water where they are exposed and we are protected by the forest.
The more likely attack then is across the bridge. That middle island is the key it has a village for healing injured units and forests in which we fight so well.

Mermaids like elves have a powerful and native ability in magic though theirs is considerably different than that of the elves. Those who master this ability are held in high regard and their skill is used in a multitude of crafts many of which humanity would never dream. The obvious use in war is forbidden against their own race ‚Äî this power is the greater part of what protects their people from the monsters that wander out of the abyss.

A skeleton archer is little different from the ‚Äòskeletons‚Äô which often accompany it ‚Äî it is a sin against nature a warrior raised from the dead to fight once again.

Garak
I believe that there was once a great empire in these lands long ago before the sands came.
I‚Äôve seen the ancient remains of stone castles and markers in the sands. The paths of the ancients may serve us yet again. If we follow the paths from oasis to oasis we may be able to survive the thirst and heat of the desert. But there are worse dangers in these sands than thirst we must be wary and scout our way carefully.
Well the sooner we reach Pinnacle Rock the better. Onwards!
Wait. I think I spotted something ahead of us
Maybe I spoke too soon. Curse Uria he has even blotted out the stars all is darkness. Kaleh our course is clear we must destroy that abomination.
No I shall have my revenge. I shall show you that darkness is strongest just before dawn. Death and decay grant me my vengeance!
Maybe I spoke too soon. Curse Uria they have even blotted out the stars all is darkness. Kaleh our course is clear we must destroy one of these abominations. Whether it be the thing that has taken our friend or the spectral evil that remains one of them must die for this battle to end. We have no choice.
But to kill Garak? How can we?
The stench of death is in the air.
The voices say I have no choice I must attack!
This is the end of the line. The water is too deep for me to continue any further. I‚Äôm freezing cold wet and I can‚Äôt see a thing. I‚Äôm not exactly sure what I‚Äôm doing up here. Some strange influence made me want to come up here but I don‚Äôt know what made me think it could be of any good.

Troll High Shaman
I thought that‚Äôs what all the trolls looked like. I suppose we‚Äôll just try to find the one that shouts the loudest.
So you dug these tunnels all by yourselves?
Long ago before the damned trolls invaded we spent our days digging tunnels all through these mountains. Oh the ore and precious stones we mined! The mines were filled with the joyful sound of dwarven hammer and dwarven song and our jeweled halls glowed as brightly as the sun. Human and elf princes would pay us royally for the craftsmanship of our forges. But now the tunnels are silent and we spend our days hunting those accursed trolls. But there‚Äôs no point dwelling on the past. There‚Äôs more work to be done! Still we have our honor and I promise you do this for us and you will be rewarded handsomely.
I thank you. Come on people no celebrating yet we still have work left to do!
They‚Äôve come for my precious. It‚Äôs mine yes it is. They shan‚Äôt have it no they shan‚Äôt. We shall kill them all yes yes we will.
Curse them! We hates them!
What‚Äôs this? His clothes were in rags and yet he had this ancient jeweled amulet hanging around his neck. It contains a huge amethyst that seems to glow faintly with a strange purple light. I wonder where he got such a trinket?
The rune is still there glowing mysteriously. I still have no idea why it was put here but it‚Äôs obviously powerful and magical a combination of things which I am hesitant to mess with.
I don‚Äôt know. When I last came this way I got scared by all the runes and things moving in the shadows and I explored no further.
The many tracks left by countless feet clearly show that this fort must have once been heavily occupied but now this area is empty except for those two glowing runes in the center. When I last came this way I got scared by the runes and other things moving in the shadows and explored no further. I‚Äôm afraid I cannot advise you which way to go from here.
Well we can‚Äôt spend all day thinking about it. Pick a direction Kaleh.
Wait those runes are giving off a cool blue light and for some reason they don‚Äôt seem as threatening as the burning red ones we saw before. Perhaps some of the magic left behind here could help us if someone was brave enough to step into them.
I feel refreshed and rejuvenated!
But my king told me to protect you from all dangers and I plan to keep that oath. I do not like the above ground it is too open and exposed; I feel that I could be attacked from any direction. But an oath is an oath and so I will follow you and your people wherever you may go and protect you as best I can. The tunnels cannot stay flooded forever; later perhaps if am able to return this way I may be able to find my way back to my homeland. But for now I am yours to command.
Looks like the guards at this outpost had been saving away a bit of loot. I don‚Äôt suppose they‚Äôre going to mind anymore if we made use of it.
Praise Eloh it is so good to be outside again. To see the sky stretching out above me to feel the wind in my face
I think we finally made it outside. I‚Äôd forgotten how big the sky is and how windy it can be.
Can you see very far? Do you have any idea where we are?
Thank you. I am not very good at fighting on the dry ground.
All the other scouting parties have returned except for one. Tanstafaal and his scouts haven‚Äôt reported back yet. I‚Äôm starting to get worried.
They were sent due north. From Esanoo‚Äôs description it sounds like they were headed right for the human settlement. I hope nothing bad has happened to them.
Things are coming to a head. I‚Äôm worried about Tanstafaal and your merfolk friends. Time is of the essence so let‚Äôs move out as soon as possible.
Blood is Thicker than Water
I have followed you this far Kaleh I will not abandon you now. But I admit that my faith is shaken. If that is not our god than what is it?
I do not know but given what I have seen of the humans I think following her would lead us down a dark road indeed. One that I personally do not want to discover the end of.
The chieftain told me to serve you and it will take more than this to shatter my confidence in you lad. But those elves must be out on a different island how will we cross the deep water?
I believe that in this we can help. We are very grateful for all you have done for us Kaleh and though we assure that we mean you no harm you are right that actions speak louder than words. We are more familiar with the waters than you are and we noticed that there are two shallow paths leading to the island where the other elves must be. We can show you these paths and help you across so that you may put down this rebellion.
Thank you I‚Äôm sure you will be very useful in the shallow waters. All right people I don‚Äôt want to kill any more than I have to. Too much blood has been spilled already. Knock ‚Äôem out wound them kill them only if you must. But we must stop Tanstafaal in his lunacy before he destroys us entirely.
No no no one is blaming you Kaleh.
Many who have seen dark times wish they could go back and remake the past. But that is not in our power all we can do now is do what seems right in the time that is allotted to us. Do not succumb to despair Kaleh or else Yechnagoth has already won.
Yes remember boy the fight is not yet lost while we still draw breath.
You are right. I believe Melusand strange as her tale sounds. From all I have seen Yechnagoth truly is a scourge on this earth and I would gladly give up my life for a chance to destroy her once and for all. But this is not a choice that I can make for all of our people.
She should be made to pay for all that she has done to our people and if I should die in the attempt then so be it. I will not leave your side now Kaleh.
Kaleh! No!
He‚Äôs still breathing. Eloh what grace I have give unto him.
He‚Äôs stirring.
Aye there‚Äôs still life in the boy. But where is the foul creature that did this to him?
The little one is not dead yet. But where is evil lady that did this to him?

Chapter 3 As we continued north through the desert the looming hills and mountains promised blessed relief from the seemingly never-ending sand. Soon we got to the end of the foothills and we decided to rest there for the night. As tired as I was of marching across the sand I felt strangely afraid. I had lived my entire life in the sands; they were my home and the rocky hills and white glistening mountaintops seemed foreign and foreboding.
Chapter 5 We plunged into the darkness shepherding long lines of our people along the cramped passageway deeper and deeper beneath the roots of the mountains. We had brought along palm torches and we had scavenged other torches from the orcs so we had enough light sources at least for the moment. Even so the guttering torches shed little light and shadows flickered everywhere. The walls were damp and clammy the air seemed stale and the sound of our footsteps echoed up and down the passageway.
Chapter 6 The troll Zurg led us through a maze of twisting passages speaking scarcely a word. Finally after what seemed like hours of marching he stopped. He motioned us to be very quiet and we crept forward; all I could hear was the soft patter of feet and my heavy breathing. Even that little noise seemed to echo off the cramped walls of our rough-hewn passage. I was suddenly aware of the sheer mass of rock and earth above us and for a moment I despaired of ever seeing the sun again. Then I grabbed my sword with fresh determination and vowed to see this mission through.
I do not know how long we tramped through those tiny dark passages; time seemed to flow differently down there deep under the earth. But when we finally got to our destination what I saw was breathtaking. We entered into a large cavern where the dwarves had built a huge city out of stone. Protected by stone walls and gates that were bigger than I had ever seen the place seemed virtually impregnable. As we entered I marveled at their stonework and I saw that the place was crawling with dwarves. It was bigger than any village I had ever seen.
The dwarves led us through to the far side of the city where they let us stay in several auxiliary caverns which normally served as store rooms. The accommodations were a bit cramped but for the first time since I had plunged into the earth I felt safe.

Wonderful! Our troops have finally defeated Lanissa and her soldiers. The ancient castle is ours!
It is amazing how far one can see from the highest tower of the castle. We can watch the whole island. So now I wonder why Lanissa did not see us and thus did not prepare. Be that as it may some things will never come to the light of day. The only important issue at the moment are the opposing troops still left. We have discovered enemy positions held by Erwyn to the north and east of the castle. He is known to be a strong warlord and surely commands the strongest warriors. In the south we caught sight of some food infrastructures guarded by Jomo ‚Äì a younger warlord ‚Äì and we should take care of those infrastructures so we can cut off our enemies‚Äô food supply.

Erwyn Defeated
Great! Erwyn gave up when he saw his last buildings burning down. That‚Äôs one less strong warlord on this island!

Establish a solid food production
Food Production
Food is very important for mines and military training areas. Establish a well working food environment by building at least one farm one blackroot farm and a mill. The two kinds of flour together with water from a well will be baked into bread in a bakery so build a bakery and a well too.
The other two important food wares are smoked fish and smoked meat. Raw meat is delivered from a hunter. A fisher gets the fish out of the sea while a fish breeder makes sure that a school of fish does not go extinct by breeding more. Make sure that there are always fish left otherwise the fish breeder won‚Äôt be able to breed new ones. The smoking happens in a smokery you will need at least two of those.
Build a farm and a blackroot farm
I agree with you and I have punished the troublemakers severely. But it is very difficult to keep my men quiet they are bored and have nothing to do. I would like to ramp up their drill. I think more routine in their life would keep them occupied and focused on their duties. I would need a dungeon and a labyrinth for them. I have the plans ready but I guess they won‚Äôt come cheap.
I do not fear the cost and labor as long as it keeps your people at bay. You shall get your buildings. But note that I will not tolerate any rogue soldier; if similar things happen again I will make you responsible for them. Dismissed.
Jundlina Received a Letter
I received an invitation from Sidolus. The first day of training in the newly finished labyrinth will be tomorrow. The dungeon is done as well and will start its work soon. I am looking forward to tomorrow; I am very interested in how our soldiers are trained and I wonder if the additional workload will keep them from bullying the civilian population.
Jundlina Considers the Economy
Thron is Considering the Future
Boldreth seems more and more torn as the days go by. The spirits of my fellows sink as the cold season approaches and we are still living in no more than huts and barracks. I never intended to stay out here in the wilderness for so long ‚Äì but I never thought my brothers would engage in this senseless battle for so long either.
Perhaps it‚Äôs time to make ourselves feel a little more at ease here. Perhaps it‚Äôs time to give those who still live and think united a new home replacing what is now lost to us? Until we can return to the place we once called our home
Somebody Comes up to You
An old man says
Build a lumberjack‚Äôs hut
Build a ranger‚Äôs hut
Build a sentry on the eastern border
You should eventually also build a reed yard and a lime kiln.
Build up a small food economy
Build a quarry in the south to cut some granite and marble out of the rocks.
These might be used for future buildings.
A Dark Night
Diary of Lutius
What has become of our Empire? I really ask this question ‚Äì why did my king forbid me from fighting against that monstrous Barbarian tribe who first acted as a peaceful friend and then attacked my army in the darkest night?
Marble on the Mountain
Saledus smiles
Sire I‚Äôve got good news for you As I walked to the east I found a larger mountain. I am not absolutely sure ‚Äì a geologist should check if I am right ‚Äì but I believe we could mine marble from some places on the mountain.
It would be a good source for bolstering our supply of quality marble beyond the meager quantities available from the quarry. Perhaps you were right when you said that this island was like paradise.
Please expand to that mountain and start mining marble.
I think we should try to reveal some building space by cutting up all the rocks in a quarry.
Additionally this would gain us some granite and some marble to build up our new world. We can use them as soon as there will finally be enough space for buildings.
Amalea‚Äôs New Instructions
Good news from the people Lutius. I got the message that our first quarry has started its work today.
Perhaps it would be a good idea to wait until it has cleared some space and then build up a basic construction material industry.
Yes my fellow soldiers we have done it! We have met all the challenges that were put in front of us. But my heart is still with our home. We shall set sail as soon as possible to help defend the Empire from the Barbarian tribe.
Finally we have discovered a piece of our shrine. Praise Neptune!
We have discovered another piece of our shrine. Praise Neptune!
Finally we have discovered the last piece of our shrine. Now we can reassemble it to worship our god. Praise Neptune!
Artifact Found
Now we can start building farms to produce the beer which our miners need so desperately.
But I‚Äôm afraid that this problem hasn‚Äôt been the last in our economy.
Amalea has Good News
Amalea smiles for the first time in weeks
Lutius well done so far. I just got the news that we have finished the basic buildings to obtain some construction materials.
Now it is time to find out why this big mess around us could have happened. But first of all we should have some wine to celebrate our victory and our reclaimed freedom.
The Enemy is Near
Saledus is alerted
Sire although we don‚Äôt have enough fully trained soldiers yet we just have made contact with the enemy.
We have to finish them off and regain control over our lands. They shall regret deeply that they ever came!
Be Prepared
Our mines are working well. We can now produce all the tools we need and some weapons as well.
We could use these weapons to equip some new soldiers. I hope we won‚Äôt find enemies here but it is always better to be prepared. New soldiers are equipped in a barracks with a short sword and a fur garment the uniform of all honorable warriors.
We will need a barracks of course; a reindeer farm to produce fur and a sewing room to sew the fur into garments. The reindeer farm produces some meat as a by-product of fur and it also trains reindeer to help our carriers on busy roads.
I advise to build all those buildings within a short distance of each other and to construct two warehouses nearby One should be set to store only weapons armor ores metal and coal; the other to store building materials.
Chieftain Reebaud! We have a serious problem. We have discovered a mountain where we might be able to start mining coal and iron but we have no miners nor any picks to equip them with.
And we don‚Äôt have any iron left. We must find a way to get some metal for forging new picks. Unfortunately I have no idea how to do this.
Getting new metal
This is terrible news! Without iron or the means to produce any we are stuck like this forever! You must come up with a solution.
I have seen some advanced weapons in our warehouses. Perhaps it would be possible to smelt them back into metal? But that seems like a waste of the precious swords
Waiting for the Hut to be Finished
I wanted to teach you how to build new flags but it seems you have already found out on your own. Well done!
Now you have split the road in two parts with a carrier each. This means less work for him and higher efficiency for us. You should therefore always place as many flags as possible on your roads.
Now we only have to wait till the hut is finished.

Enhance your fortress to a citadel
Enhance your fortress to a mighty citadel.
The citadel can house 12 soldiers and it is the biggest military building the Barbarians can build. It also costs a lot of resources and takes a long time to build. It is most suited to guard strategically important points like constricted points or mountains.
Defeat your Enemy
Great work the citadel is finished. But what‚Äôs that? A hostile tribe has settled next to us while the citadel was under construction! Do you see how they took away a part of our land? And our lumberjack has now lost his place of work. This is what I was talking about. Let‚Äôs take our land back and defeat the enemy!
You can also use the hotkey ‚Äòb‚Äô.

The Ristretto Image Viewer is an application that can be used to view and scroll through images run a slideshow of images open images with other applications like an image-editor or configure an image as the desktop wallpaper.
This version comes with the improvements such as thumbnail usage as appicon and update to the first image in the image-list when receiving a ready-signal required to show the thumbnail once it's generated.
This release contains lots of translation-updates and a crash when configuring the 'limit-quality' property.
This version comes with several changes such as online documentation on docs.xfce.org the option to limit the maximum image-quality to the screen dimensions to improve memory-usage and performance - now ristretto renders at full quality with this option disabled only one toolbar - instead of two a quick-launch button on the toolbar to execute an editor the option to pick a default-editor per mime-type an optional clock that shows up when ristretto is fullscreen Ristretto now shows a 'Loading..' message in the statusbar to indicate when it is busy and progressive loading of directories to prevent lockup of the UI. This version is designed to work with version 4.10 of Xfce.

The pyalsa Python module is missing
Solfege was configured to use the Python modules from www.alsa-project.org but the modules were not found. You must reconfigure sound in the preferences window (Ctrl-F12) or restart Solfege in a way that it finds the modules.
MIDI setup
You should configure sound from the 'Sound' page of the preferences window.
You should configure sound from the preferences window and try to use an external midi player. Or try to recompile the program and check for error messages to see why the module is not built.

The program will play the tone A (440 hz) for you and display a chord that you must sing. Solfege does not yet have support for microphone so you will have to decide yourself if your answer is correct or not.
Selecting exercises
Selecting exercises works like navigating a web page and clicking on links. Press AltLeft to move to the previous page or F5 to move to the front page.
Scales are a complex matter. For example is the greek lydian (C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C) different from the medieval and modern lydian (C-D-E-F#-G-A-B-C). You can read about all the scales used in GNU Solfege here.
Solfege has three variants of scale exercises so far.
If you find inverting intervals difficult then you can memorise that the intervals E-C A-F and B-G are minor. The other four are major. Then you examine the accidentals to see if they change the specific name. This is done exactly the same way as for seconds.
Sevenths are identified the same way as sixths. When you invert a seventh you get a second.
If you find inverting intervals difficult then you can memorise that the intervals C-B and F-E are major. The other five are minor. Then you examine the accidentals to see if they change the specific name. This is done exactly the same way as for seconds.
Inverting intervals
You invert an interval when you move the lowest tone of an interval one octave higher or the highest tone one octave lower. The general name changes this way

Patterns and LanguagesPatterns are task-oriented collections of multiple packages that install like one. The installation of the File Server pattern for example will install various packages needed for running such a server.If you want to install a particular language you may want to do so via the Language tool from the YaST control center.
Software details in the box belowExplore the available information about the package in the box below. Note that more information is available for installed packages than for those only available from a repository.You can also pick a specific version of the package to install from this box.
PurposeThis tool gives you control on overviewing and picking patches. You may also reverse patches that have been applied to the system.
UsageCategoriesPatches are grouped as followsSecurity patches a software flaw that could be exploited to gain restricted privilege.Recommended fixes non-security related flaws (e.g. data corruption performance slowdown)Optional ones that only apply to few users.Documentation fixes documentation errors.YaST patches for the YaST control center tools.
Only patches that apply to your system will be visible. You can be sure that the decision to make a patch available is not done trivially.If you are looking for applications enhancements you should check for upgrades on the Software Manager.

A Klein bottle is the 4D analog of a moebius strip. You can walk on the surface of the bottle or rotate it in 4D or walk on it while it rotates in 4D. Inspired by Thomas Banchoff's book "Beyond the Third Dimension Geometry Computer Graphics and Higher Dimensions" Scientific American Library 1990. https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleinbottle Written by Carsten Steger.
FluidBalls
Models the physics of bouncing balls or of particles in a gas or fluid depending on the settings. If "Shake Box" is selected then every now and then the box will be rotated changing which direction is down (in order to keep the settled balls in motion.) Written by Peter Birtles and Jamie Zawinski.
UnknownPleasures
Points attract each other up to a certain distance and then begin to repel each other. The attraction/repulsion is proportional to the distance between any two particles similar to the strong and weak nuclear forces. Written by Jamie Zawinski and John Pezaris.

GLBlur
Flowing field effects from the vapor trails around a moving object. This is done by rendering the scene into a small texture then repeatedly rendering increasingly-enlarged and increasingly-transparent versions of that texture onto the frame buffer. As such it's quite GPU-intensive if you don't have a very good graphics card it will hurt your machine bad. Written by Jamie Zawinski.

The amount of free memory for query cache.
The number of cache hits.
The number of queries added to the cache.
The number of queries that have been removed from the cache to free up memory for caching new queries. This information can help you tune the query cache size. The query cache uses a least recently used (LRU) strategy to decide which queries to remove from the cache.

Creating a foreign key over a non-indexed column would automatically create an index on it. Alternatively you can define an index below before creating the foreign key.
Query caching method
Suboptimal caching method.
You are using the MySQL Query cache with a fairly high traffic database. It might be worth considering to use memcached instead of the MySQL Query cache especially if you have multiple slaves.
Query cache not running efficiently it has a low hit rate.
Consider increasing {querycachelimit}.
Enable {concurrentinsert} by setting it to 1
Setting {concurrentinsert} to 1 reduces contention between readers and writers for a given table. See also MySQL Documentation
